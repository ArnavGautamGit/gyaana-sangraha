# Mutual Funds
> Funds of multiple people are pooled thus forming a large corpus which are run by Professional Investment Bankers to invest in the [[Stock Market\|Stock Market]].

Since run by Professional Bankers, it is near impossible to get better returns than Mutual Funds in the first 4-6 years of Investing.

Every Mutual Fund nowadays has a unit price - that is price of 1 unit of Mutual Funds. Unit Prices (also called as [[Net Asset Value (NAV)\|Net Asset Value (NAV)]]) are calculated using the formula:
$$\Large NAV = \dfrac{Total \ Assets - Total \ Liabilities}{Number \ of \ Outstanding \ units}$$
These (NAVs) can be considered as the mutual fund equivalent of a stock price - which is variable and when multipled by the number of shares give us the [[Market Capitalisation\|Market Capitalisation]] of the company.

Equity Mutual Funds and Debt Mutual Funds either in Demat or Physical form can be used as collateral against Loans. Equity MF will get you 50% of the Fund Unit Amount as Loan while Debt FUnds can get you 80-85% of the Fund Unit Amount as loan.

### Classification
Each Mutual Fund is unique since it is run by different professionals and on different Risk-to-Reward profiles. Hence they are classified into 3 major types:

1. [[Small-Cap Mutual Funds\|Small-Cap Mutual Funds]] invest in smaller companies and hence have ahigher risk since these companies can shut down anytime.
2. [[Medium-Cap Mutual Funds\|Medium-Cap Mutual Funds]] invest in medium-sized companies and have a lower risk and lower [[Volatility\|Volatility]] than Small-Cap but are still prone to high ups and downs due to still being in competition with other similarly sized corporations.
3. [[Large-Cap Mutual Funds\|Large-Cap Mutual Funds]] invest in already established massive giants who are like the elephants of the market - they are big and heavy, but move slowly. Hence it is lowest ranked in risk and Volatility but also least amount of risk.
4. [[Equity Mutual Fund\|Equity Mutual Fund]] invest in Equity ([[Stock Market\|Stock Market]]).
5. [[Debt Mutual Fund\|Debt Mutual Fund]] invest in Debt.
6. [[Index Mutual Fund\|Index Mutual Fund]] invests in the top few companies trading on that index. Example: Nifty50 invests in the Top 50 largest companies of the National Stock Exchange (NSE) which are selected on the basis of [[Market Capitalisation\|Market Capitalisation]].
