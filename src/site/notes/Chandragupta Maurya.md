# Chandragupta Maurya
> The first ruler of the [[Mauryan Empire\|Mauryan Empire]] and desciple of [[Vishnugupta Chanakya\|Vishnugupta Chanakya]].

Chandragupta is said to be born in a Shudra family - although some sources say he was a Kshatriya. It is a reflection of how some people were still not ready to accept Chandragupta as the king due to his status - this could stem from political decisions and policy-based dissatisfaction & not necessarily just casteism.

Chanakya saw all the qualities of a good ruler in Chandragupta & the only way he could have met young Chandra is if Chandragupta was either already studying at a Gurukul associated with [[Takshila University\|Takshila University]] or he had applied to join one of them - meaning that people from Shudra families were allowed to study in Ancient India.

### Conquests & Reign
After [[Alexander The Great\|Alexander The Great]] passed in 323 BC and [[Selucid Empire\|Selucid Empire]] became independent from [[Philip III of Greece\|Philip III of Greece]], Chandragupta was able to takeover the reigns of India from [[Dhana Nanda\|Dhana Nanda]].
He had to fight instability for quite a solid period of time while [[Selucus I Nicator\|Selucus I Nicator]] was also doing the same in his Selucid empire - which is why their first war was after 321 BC when [[Mauryan Empire\|Mauryan Empire]] was already stabilising.

Chandragupta defeated Selucus multiple times but did not spoil his relationship with him. Gifting him 500 elephants & accepting the invite of [[Megasthenes\|Megasthenes]] to come to his kingdom as an envoy who wrote [[Indica\|Indica]].

### Later Life & Retirement
Due to not being able to protect his people & provide for them during a famine in the years around 300 BC to 297 BC, he coronated his son [[Bindusāra Maurya\|Bindusāra Maurya]] and abdigated from the royal court voluntarily and decided to retire into [[Vānprastha\|Vānprastha]]. 

During his [[Vānprastha\|Vānprastha]] years, he came in contact with a [[Jaina (Jainism)\|Jaina]] monk under whose guidance & influence he converted to [[Jaina (Jainism)\|Jainism]] and moved to Shravanbelagova in an attempt to gain moksha. In Jain teachings, if a person feels they are close to attaining Moksha at the end of this very lifetime then they try to cause a faster death first by fasting, then self-harm via plucking nails among other methods.

Chandragupta knew that his son would be coming to look for him & meet him - possibly seeking guidance, being re-attached to him would not only ruin his chance to attain moksha and escape the cycle of life & death but it would also make it hard for him to stay a monk. It would also remind him of his failure as a king - unable to protect his people against a simple famine. So Chandragupta hastened the process beginning with fasting and then nail-plucking and hair-plucking to cause death by pain & bloodloss... by the time Bindusāra found out about his father's location & arrived in Shravanbelagova his father had already passed away. Bindusāra then became the proponent of the [[Ājīvikā\|Ājīvikā]] philosophy where everything is pre-destined and nothing is within your control.
