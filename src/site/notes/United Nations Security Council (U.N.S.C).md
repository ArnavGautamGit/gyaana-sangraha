# United Nations Security Council (U.N.S.C)
> A Council of Permanent and Non-Permanent [[United Nations Security Council (U.N.S.C)\|UNSC]] [[State (United Nations)\|Member States]] who are responsible for ensuring world peace by initiating an enforcement action on another state if they violate any [[International Law\|International Law]]. The Enforcement may be of any nature the council agrees to whether economic or military nature.

The UNSC is considered the council where the real geopolitical power rests since any Permanent Member may be able to Veto any resolution calling out their crimes and any  member with a non-permanent seat may get the statement altered to shield their assets.

Regardless, it is safe to say that giving a set of states the power to Veto a democratically voted resolution just because they won a war 80 years ago is the most undemocratic arrangement which may poke a hole in [[United Nations (U.N)\|The UN]] to create similar situations which caused the downfall of the [[League of Nations\|League of Nations]] & beginning of [[The Second World War (WW2)\|The Second World War (WW2)]].

### Permanent Members
Members of the UNSC who were the victors of [[The Second World War (WW2)\|The Second World War (WW2)]].
States like India were offered permanent membership since we were approaching and convincing other states to join the [[United Nations (U.N)\|United Nations (U.N)]] even before we even became Independent.
please see: [[India & Permanent UNSC Membership\|India & Permanent UNSC Membership]] for full story.

1. United States of America (USA)
2. [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR)\|Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR)]] (now succeeded by the Russian Federation)
3. [[Communist China\|Communist China]] (officially called the "People's Republic of China")
4. France
5. United Kingdom (UK)

The UNSC reserves the right for their Permanent Members being able to quash any motion raised or any resolution passed by the [[United Nations General Assembly (U.N.G.A)\|UN General Assembly]] using their power of Veto. 
Similar rights do not exist for Non-Permanent Members.

### Non-Permanent Members
Non-permanent members are selected in rotation from the [[United Nations General Assembly (U.N.G.A)\|UNGA]] for 2 years as their tenure.
During these 2 years they may hold presidency for 2 months (which is also in rotation)
India held the presidency when we also hosted the G20 in New Delhi.

Pakistan held the non-permanent member seat around the [[Pahalgam Terror Attack\|Pahalgam Terror Attack]] and they leveraged their UNSC seat to shield the [[The Resistance Front (TRF)\|The Resistance Front (TRF)]] terrorists (TRF is a known offshoot of the [[Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT)\|Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT)]] terrorist group).
