# Hinduism
> The oldest religion a section of humanity has been pracitising on planet earth & the oldest philosophies. It has formed the basis of many [[Indic Philosophy\|Indian Philosophies]]. I also am a proud Hindu.

Its major scriptural language is [[Sanskrit\|Sanskrit]], although the scriptures have been translated into all other major languages spoken in India at some point thoroughout [[Indian History\|Indian History]] by the Brahmins. The Europeans may have also translated them into their languages eventually at various points of time but I frankly do not care.

### Major Sects in Hinduism
Hinduism itself is divided into three major sects: [[Vaishnava Tradition of Hinduism\|Vaishnavism]], [[Shaiva Tradition in Hinduism\|Shaivism]] and [[Shākta Tradition in Hinduism\|Shaktism]]. 
Although there are other sects such as [[Smārta\|Smārta]] but they are not as popular and limited.
All these sects are further subdivided but it is important to note that Vaishnavism is the largest of them all.

### Philosophies in Hinduism
Although I have a note on [[Āstika Philosophies\|Āstika Philosophies]], not every Indian philosophy that believes in a God or Creator Being is actually a part of Hinduism - some may have taken Hinduism or one of the Hindu Philosophies as its foundation but not every Āstika Philosophy is Hindu.

There are Six major hindu philosophies:
1. [[Vedānta\|Vedānta]] (largest in followers)
2. [[Mīmānsa\|Mīmānsa]]
3. [[Sāńkhya\|Sāńkhya]]
4. [[Yōga (Philosophy)\|Yōga]]
5. [[Nyāya Darshana\|Nyāya]]
6. [[Vaisheshika\|Vaisheshika]] (smallest in followers)

It is important to note that each one of these philosophies may also have their own schools of thought within them, similar to how [[Vedānta\|Vedānta]] has SIX distinct schools of thought (or one may call them "sub-philosophies") on top of the overarching thought.

### Branch Religions
Many later religions have built upon the base of Hindu Philosophy and other athiest philosophies that existed in India that were considered to be athiest interpretations of major concepts in Hindu History & Hindu Cosmology.

These branch philosophies eventually became independent religions but their core philosophies and tenets have been inspired (consciously or unconsciously) by the logic, arguments, events or people depicted in Hindu Scriptural Texts:
1. [[Jaina Philosophy (Jainism)\|Jaina Philosophy (Jainism)]]
2. [[Bauddha Philosophy (Buddhism)\|Bauddha Philosophy (Buddhism)]]
3. [[Sikhism\|Sikhism]] (the philosophy is called "Sikkhi")

### Political Representation & the constant battle against Communists
The Political Ideology of Hindus standing for their dharma and Hindus standing for each other (which may be interpreted as "Hindu Majoritarianism" or "Hindu Extremism" by the haters) is called [[Hindutva\|Hindutva]]. The term was coined by [[Veer Savarkar\|Veer Savarkar]] & holds an extremely long history which is too long for this note.

In countries like India where there is a sizable population of Muslims and Christians compared to Hindus (20% of 1.4 Billion Indians are Muslims & hence a strong votebank) the local political wings such as Local [[Communism\|Communist]] & [[Socialism\|Socialist]] Leaders oppose [[Hindutva\|Hindutva]] but in regions like Nepal where almost all of the population is homogenously Hindu, Communists have to survive by relating themselves with Hindus and openly use Hindu Swastika on their flags. 
At the same time globally, [[Communism\|Commies]] hate Hindutva & the BJP.
