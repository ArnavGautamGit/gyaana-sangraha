# The Onion Router (TOR)
> Originally created by the US Government, TOR is a browser used to access the [[Dark Web\|Dark Web]] and works by moving your data through [[Anonymous Proxy Servers\|Anonymous Proxy Servers]] called TRON poxies which add layers of anonymity with each proxy server you connect to similar to the layers of an onion.

TOR is anonymous but traceable i.e., you can be traced through the network.
A country like the USA would not release secret government creations online unless they can monitor and snoop all its users and [[Edward Snowden\|Edward Snowden]] will agree any day.

It is slower than regular internet for people outside the USA and the reason for that is the major number of intermediary nodes for TOR are in the USA so we always have latency when travelling that distance through more servers than usual.

### Slightly more Secure
TOR browser does not have JS in-built and you cannot load JS with these sights so browsing piracy websites is easier since the pages cannot be click through or the pages cannot display pop-up ads.
