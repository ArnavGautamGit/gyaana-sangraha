Under the rule of [[Bimbisāra\|Bimbisāra]], Magadha attacked and won over the Central Indian Mahajanpada of Avanti (with its capitals in Ujjain and Mahishmati).

Soon under [[Ajātashatru\|Ajātashatru]] and [[Shishunāga\|Shishunāga]], Magadha was able to defeat Chedi mahajanpada in southern Gangetic Plains until the reign of the first empire-builder [[Mahapadma Nanda\|Mahapadma Nanda]] who laid the foundation for the [[Nanda Empire\|Nanda Empire]] by defeating ALL and EVERY Mahajanapada in the Indian Subcontinent.
