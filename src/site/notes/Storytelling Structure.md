# Storytelling Structure
> Structure of a story told via any Storytelling Medium - from Movies and TV to Books and Plays.

The Structure is present to make sure the people understand what is happening in the story and this structure has emerged after years and years of telling stories - whether real historical stories or folklore.

The Structure comprises of the following in the given order:
[[Exposition\|Exposition]]
[[Rising Action\|Rising Action]]
[[Climax\|Climax]]
[[Falling Action\|Falling Action]]
[[Resolution\|Resolution]]

The existence of this structure does not mean that one is FORCED to adhere to it or HAS to adhere to it. There have been many stories which have not followed this arc & yet have become massive hits. Many movies leave a part of the [[Resolution\|Resolution]] for the sequel to unravel or some may end on an absolute [[Cliffhanger\|Cliffhanger]] - with no ending in sight.
