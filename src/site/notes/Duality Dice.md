# Duality Dice
> The 2d12 Dice of different colours used to play [[Daggerheart\|Daggerheart]] where one represents a Hope Dice and the other is the Fear Dice.

When you roll a check or save with the Duality Dice, if the combined score (with any applicable bonuses) clear the DC, you succeed the roll and if the combined score is below the DC, you fail (like most [[Table-Top Role-Playing Game\|TTRPG]]).

### Advantage & Disadvantage
If the player making the roll has advantage, they roll an extra 1d6 and add its roll into the sum. On a disadvantage, the 1d6 outcome is subtracted from the sum of the Duality Dice.

### Outcomes
Regardless of the success or failure, if you role higher with the Hope Dice, you get +1 [[Hope Token\|Hope Token]]. On the contrary, a +1 [[Fear Token\|Fear Token]] is awarded to the [[Game Master (GM)\|Game Master (GM)]] if the Fear Dice Rolls higher.

- On a Success/Failure with [[Hope Token\|Hope Token]], you clear/fail the check and get a [[Hope Token\|Hope Token]]. Minor Consequences for failing which can be sorted by spending the Hope.
- On a Success/Failure with Fear, you clear/fail the challenge and you can face consequences for giving away the [[Fear Token\|Fear Token]].
- If Both dice roll the same number (regardless of if they clear the DC), the character gets a Critical Success!!! Character gets +1 [[Hope Token\|Hope Token]], +1 [[Stress Point\|Stress Point]] and extra cool stuff.
