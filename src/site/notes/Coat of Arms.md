# Coat of Arms
> It is a section of a [[Heraldic Achievement\|Heraldic Achievement]] which is to be actually painted on a shield of soldiers or to be displayed as postage stamps, wax seals, wall decorations etc.

Soldiers would be required to use the Ruling House's or the State's Coat of Arms unless they are placed in the service of a Knight or Lord who holds an independent Coat of Arms. 

The State's Coat of Arms were used to create jackets decoraed entirely as a massive wearable "Coat" of Arms which is called a tabard.

I have designed a [[Personal Coat of Arms\|Personal Coat of Arms]] which I would not reveal until my copyright is approved. I am going to apply for copyright over the artwork since it is my original artwork which will be used as a personal brand.
