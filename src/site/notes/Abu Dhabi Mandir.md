Today, Prime Minister Modi will inaugurate (i.e., perform the consecration of) the BAPS Hindu temple in the UAE. The temple, built at the cost of 700 crore, will be Abu Dhabi's first Hindu temple

So why would the PM travel for this event, just months before general elections in India?
There's two reasons why & they are explored further.

### Reason 1: Cultural diplomacy for politics
To be clear, India has used temples in its foreign policy before.
Typically, they have been used to build closer ties with countries with which India has close historic ties.

- Since the 1990s, India has used this approach with Southeast Asia It has taken on projects like repairing Cambodia's iconic Angkor Wat temple
- India focused on its shared heritage of Hinduism and Buddhism with SE Asia
- These faiths flowed from India to the region around 1600 years ago and became a way for ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ to connect with these countries

However, the inauguration of the BAPS Hindu Mandir in Abu Dhabi is slightly different
- Increasingly, temples are also a symbol of cultural nationalism
- India's Foreign Minister S Jaishankar recent book "Why Bharat Matters" lays out how the current govt sees its policy
	- To Jaishankar, "Bharat" refers to a country that is more confident and assertive in its status as a "civilization"
	- That cultural confidence has changed India's foreign policy
	- Cultural symbols like Hindu temples abroad are a sign of Indian culture spreading and rising

So that broadly explains why PM Modi is visiting the UAE for the BAPS temple inauguration

***==Opening a new Hindu temple in the heart of the Islamic Gulf allows the PM to argue that "Bharat's culture" is strong & rising in prominence globally==***

### Reason 2: Gulf-India ties improve

Improving ties with the Gulf has been one of the standout successes of Modi's time in office

For decades, India was uncomfortable with conservative Islamic monarchies

India's Middle-East policy underperformed because it didn't develop these ties

That started to change in the 1990s after the end of the Cold War

Under Modi, relations with Gulf powers like the UAE and Saudi Arabia have taken off

India has $85 billion in trade with UAE, making it one of ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³'s top 3 trading partners

It is also the 3rd largest investor in ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³

The UAE works with India on I2U2 and on the new India-Middle East Economic Corridor

It is also putting billions into ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ for the development of food parks

The two countries also have growing defence ties

And of course, there's the 3.5 million Indians living in the UAE

From what we gather, the UAE's President Mohammed bin-Zayed Al Nahyan helped push the BAPS Hindu Mandir project and provided land for it

It reflects several things: the growing importance of India and Indians in the UAE and the president's relationship with PM Modi

But, there's also something else

The BAPS temple also reflects a social change

"Today, religious conservatism at home and the export of radicalism abroad in Arabia are yielding place, especially in the UAE and Saudi Arabia, to growing religious tolerance," says @MohanCRaja

Rajamohan argues that this change has made the UAE a key ally in India's efforts to counter religious extremism at home and abroad

That has allowed increasing strategic cooperation between the two

All this explains why the BAPS Mandir event should matter to folks in India
