# Zero-Risk Bias
> Tendency to prefer options which lead to outcomes where risks are reduced to zero instead of options where risks are reduced by multiple times of the Zero-Risk choice but remain non-zero i.e., Elimination of risk is preferred to Reduction of Risk.

A singular event such as a particular heart surgery has a fixed risk, if one option eliminates it, it is better. That's not an example of Zero-Risk Bias.

Zero-Risk Bias is seen in governance where politicians prioritise elimination of risk from 5% to 0% in one field rather than pumpimg money to reduce the risks from 25% to 5% in another field. This is how favouritism in governance works.
