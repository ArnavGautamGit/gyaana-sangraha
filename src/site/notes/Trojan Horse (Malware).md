# Trojan Horse (Malware)
It is defined as:
> A Computer Program masquerading its identity & containing a hidden code which when invoked performs some unwanted or harmful functions. It appears as a different file than it is. 

***==Example==***: the harmful `.exe` files are often named as `XYZ.pdf.exe` where `.exe` is the actual extension but most operating systems hide file extensions unless specifically asked to show them - so the use only sees `XYZ.pdf` and does not realise it is harmful & clicks on it.

Since its attempt to hide its real nature under the guise of something harmless is eerily similar to the actual [[Trojan Horse (Military Tactic)\|Trojan Horse (Military Tactic)]] used in the [[The Battle of Troy\|The Battle of Troy]] which is also where this class of [[Computer Malware\|Malware]] gets its name.
