# Stall Speed
> The Speed at (or below) which any Aircraft begins to [[Stall\|Stall]].

Stall Speed is derived by the following formula:
$$\large V_s = \sqrt{\dfrac{2W}{\rho SC_{Lmax}}}$$
where, $\large S$ is the wing area, $\large\rho$ is the air density and $\large C_{Lmax}$ is the [[Maximum Lift Coefficient\|Maximum Lift Coefficient]].

***Important to note that***: Although these variables may be different depending upon the situation, Maximum Lift Coefficient is around 1.2 to 1.5 for most aircrafts while the Air Density at Sea Level is $\large 1.225 kg/m^3$
