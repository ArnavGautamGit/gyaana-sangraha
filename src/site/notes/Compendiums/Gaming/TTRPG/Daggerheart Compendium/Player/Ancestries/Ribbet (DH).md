# Ribbet (DH)
> A [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Ancestries/DH Species Ancestry\|DH Species Ancestry]] of anthromorphic bipedal frogs i.e., frogs that can walk on their two hind limbs & use the other two fore limbs as hands with semi-distinct fingers which are sometimes webbed, othertimes not. They always have a smooth skin which is very rarely warty. Their hind legs are almost twice the size of their torso.

Ribbets are the size between as [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Ancestries/Halfling (DH)\|halflings]] and [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Ancestries/Dwarf (DH)\|dwarves]]. (They are 3 to 5 feet tall) Ribbet children have short tails which further shrink as they grow, allowing them to stand up straighter. Their skin may be smooth, dry or slimy. It may also be striped or have any kind of pattern in accordance to the wishes of the players. Ribbets of Lurov have settled around [[Bridgeport\|Bridgeport]], [[Shamsi Archipelago\|Shamsi Archipelago]] and [[Ribbetton\|Ribbetton]] while none of them have a purely Ribbet-only population.

On taking Ribbet, you get the following Ancestry Features:

- ***Amphibious***: You can breathe and move naturally underwater i.e., as easily as on land.
