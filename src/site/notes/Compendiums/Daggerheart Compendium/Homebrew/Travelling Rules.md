# Travelling Rules
> Homebrew set of rules when travelling from one location to another in such an unstable world cannot simply be skipped over as a "fade-to-black".

If one is travelling on land and water, the likelyhood of being ambushed with the intent of mugging either by bandits or armed peasants looking for extra cash is never zero. There is also a chance of being ambushed by a predator (if closeby their territory), but animals hunt only during twilight. 

If travelling in the air, then unless they are on a Dragon, wild animals (such as griphons) could try and hunt them. The world of [[Lurov\|Lurov]] is fantastical in nature but it is not an ideal utopia.

### Mechanics
The GM and one player will role a 20-sided dice (d20) to get their result. If the travel is short, the Difficulty of the roll would start from 1 and will increment on intervals of 5 with increasing distance between source and destination with the maximum being 15. The Difficulty has to be beaten (i.e, the result of the d20 has to be equivalent to or higher than the Difficulty) for the players to reach their destination safely, else they get ambushed by bandits. Before the rolls are made, the players may choose to swap their dice result with the GM's dice if they wish to.

In the sea, there are going to be additional d20 roles for if there is a storm and if there is a sea moster in those waters.

Overall the probability of a smooth travel being interrupted by a threat of any kind is between 5% (at the difficulty of 1) to 75% (at the difficulty of 15). On the bright side the chances of going unscathed is between 25% to 95% which is still a better percentage considering you always have a 25% chance to get from one edge of [[Lurov\|Lurov]] to the other with only 25% chance of being interrupted.

Good Luck Adventurers! Hope you roll 16 or higher.
