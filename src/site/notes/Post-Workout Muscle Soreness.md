# Post-Workout Muscle Soreness
> A phenomenon where muscles targeted in the previous workout are sore the next day or day after from the day one worked out

This is also known as "Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness" or DOMS becuase it happens after Workout is done. The soreness that occurs during the workout and (ideally) quickly goes away during the rest between workout sets is called "[[During-Workout Muscle Soreness\|Acute Onset Muscle Soreness]]" and is covered in its own note. This note only concerns DOMS.

### Reason
When one trains their muscles, their muscles develop micro-tears. These tears in the muscle fibre are healed and reinforced by the body i.e., the torn muscle fibres are replaced by stronger ones. Muscle Soreness is a phase that occurs at the start of the recovery processs when there is a lot of fluids that reach the torn muscle fibres.

### Recovery
Recovery from Muscle Soreness has a few easy steps:
1. Cold Shower right after workout (if possible) else next day is also okay. {source: [[Post-Workout Muscle Soreness#^1\|#^1]]}
2. Good (and preferrably LONG) Sleep the night after workout.
	1. Also, it was found that people recover better if you actually have the sore muscle not fully lengthened while sleeping & have it slightly bent. {source: [[Post-Workout Muscle Soreness#^2\|#^2]]}
	2. Also important to note that I didn't feel considerable difference between both my shoulders after intense shoulder-focused workout days.
3. Plenty of water and protein after workout.
4. If you are not deeply sore, you can try a massage - otherwise avoid it.

### Decision to Workout
Better workout the muscles that are not sore and if you workout full-body than workout those muscles not taken yesterday. For Example, my Friday's Workout is comprised of Hammer Curls, Squats, Overhead Tricep Extensions and Pushups. Notice how Back and Abs Muscles were not trained & won't be sore. Next Day's Full-Body should target them and use lighter workouts on Shoulders.

If that is not possible, best option is to make the workout lighter by dropping the number of sets and reps (possibly also dropping to lower weight if needed). Make sure you can do the exercises without compromising on form and risking injury

If that is also not possible, taking a day off is the best bet is to take the day off. Follow the plan suggested in [[Post-Workout Muscle Soreness#Recovery\|#Recovery]] and hope for the best.
