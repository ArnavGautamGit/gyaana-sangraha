# Coincidence
> Situation where probability of two otherwise disconnected events allign to give one of the rare results where the events get directly or indirectly connected results

It is often miscredited to something else. For example, some events of pure coincidence are often attributed to things which cannot cause them or even things which cannot exist - such as "Allah" will destroy Israel where we know that Israel exists and Allah doesn't.
