# Graha (ग्रह)
> Although many translate Graha as the word "Planet", in Sanskrit, the word orginates from the word ग्रहण (meaning Eclipse) i.e., Graha are the Celestial Bodies that can cause or be a part of Eclipses.

The Graha may have or be placed in a varying way dependent upon an individual's Birth Details.

### Retrograde Grahas
When a Graha is retrograde in your Birth Chart, it means that the particular Graha is IMMENSELY strong but there is a catch with the increased strength. In your past life you may have misused the power it provided you & hence it is strong and gives you a chance to learn. It provides Strength with unpredictability, so the individual learns from their mistakes.

A retrograde Graha provides the individual with a buff to the Houses it rules i.e., refer to the table provided in [[Graha (ग्रह) as Rāshi Lords\|Graha (ग्रह) as Rāshi Lords]] where the Graha (if retrograde) shall provide an increased strengths to domains of its Svarāshi & hence the houses where it is located. If Jupiter is retrograde in my chart, it provides strength to the houses where [[Dhanu (धनु)\|Dhanu (धनु)]] and [[Meena (मीन)\|Meena (मीन)]] are posited.
