# Rhino: The OG Tank since 2013
Although Rhino was always a Crowd Control Warframe, its third ability of Iron Skin technically makes him a Tank according to our section on [[Warframe#Modding the Warframes\|Warframe#Modding the Warframes]] 
Rhino is classified as a Tank which also is capable of increasing its survivability using his Abilities. So he fits into two classes of survivability at the same time. 
It is unclear whether Rhino is a Health-Tank or Shield-Tank because he seems to have great amounts of both. 

The reason Rhino is considered great is that it has the ability to make The Steel Path an absolute breeze.

## Ability: Roar
Rhino's ability of Roar buffs weapon damage for the entire squad including the Rhino himself.
Rhino's this ability is not very efficient at clearing enemies unless not linked with another such ability or tactic (one of which we will discuss here).

## Ability: Iron Skin
The Ability adds armour - although at normie levels it adds only in a few thousands, it can easily scale up to a million or more with some "help" from mods!
The amount of armour gained via Iron Skin is dependent on this formula:
$$\Large Armour \ Gained = [1200 + (2.5 \times Current \ Armour)] \times Ability \ Strength$$
This means we have to mod two things:
1. Total Armour (using mods that increase Armour)
2. Ability Strength (using mods that increase Ability Strength)

We use the Ability Augment Mod "Ironclad Charge" which increases the armour rating by 50% for 10s for every enemy hit using Rhino's First Ability - Charge.

## Mods to use & How to Rhino
1. ***==For Ability Strength==***
	- Transient Fortitude 
	- Blind Rage 
	- Umbral Instensify
	- Growing Power
2. ***==For Armour==***
	- Umbral Fiber
	- Arcane Tanker (or Arcane Guardian if low level)
3. Other Mods for Survivability (like Vitality and Redirection)
4. Slap some Arcanes on the Operator bought from the Little Duck in Fortuna (Mobis Anomaly or something similar) which allows to pull all the enemies to you and then hit transference back to Warframe mode.
5. Charge through hordes of enemies and activate Iron Skin then Roar - melt all enemies around you without taking damage to Health or Shields! If you find yourself dying in the setup, try to use the Vazarin Focus School for the operator with the skill "Protective Sling" - it will make you invincible for 5s after you Void Dash through your Warframe.

To Reach almost INSANE Levels of armour (in millions), get your Helminth Segment from Son in Deimos and then get the Parasitic Armour ability (converts all shields to armour).
Best part: it also scales of off Ability Strength... so all you need to do is slap Redirection and upgrade it as far as possible! Add Primed Vigor for more madness!
