# Neo-Realism
> In [[International Studies\|International Studies]], it is defined as a Philosophy evolved from [[Realism\|Realism]] which agrees that the nature of International Politics is [[Anarchy\|Anarchic]] but argues that this Anarchic nature is not due to human greed rather due to lack of a strong & capable unified International Government and International Judiciary which can do more than pass "recommendations" to miscreant states. In short, it says that the systems in place are at fault instead of the human race.

There are no governments who run their state's foreign policy based on this Philosphy alone & there is always one of the other philosophies which supplement this one.
