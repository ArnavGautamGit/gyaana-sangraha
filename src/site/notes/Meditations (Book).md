This book along with the book by [[Seneca\|Seneca]] titled, "[[Letters from a Stoic (Book)\|Letters from a Stoic (Book)]]" lay & detail the foundation of one of the greatest western philosophy of Greek origin known as "[[Stoicism\|Stoicism]]".

Marcus Aurelius was by far known as one of the first Stoics to ever exist - along with Seneca and some of his other contemporaries. On reading the book, in Book 1 of hi original collection of Diaries, the first thing he notes in the book are lessons he learnt from his grandfather, Verus. It shows how much the philosophy of Stoicism & Marcus's understanding of it is influenced by Marcus's own upbringing, surrounding and personal experiences which shaped the world view. In a way, it also gives us a small look into Psychology and how upbringing of a person may affect their beliefs.
