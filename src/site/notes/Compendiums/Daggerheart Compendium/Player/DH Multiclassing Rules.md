# DH Multiclassing Rules
> Multiclassing is the in-game feature that allows players to further customise their characters by having them be a combination of two classes because the original character idea in their head does not exactly fit one singular class or maybe they find wacky class combinations fun. 

Multiclassing in [[Compendiums/Daggerheart Compendium/Daggerheart\|Daggerheart]] has the following rules:
1. Characters cannot multiclass before they reach Level 5
2. Retain ONE domain from your original class
3. Take ONE domain from your new class
4. Cross out the Level Up Option of "Take an Upgraded Subclass Card" meaning your character will never unlock the mastery feature of either original subclass or the new one. If you already have the Mastery Feature Unlocked, you have to give it up.

Note that Original Class's domain cards from the other domain have to be discarded completely and substituted by the new domain of the new Class. 
If you are Level 7 Wizard multiclassing into Druid, you can use the Level 7 Beastform Rules since both classes level together.
