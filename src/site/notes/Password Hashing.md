# Password Hashing
> A process of passing the [[Password\|Password]] through a [[Hashing\|Hashing]] function which converts the password to a hash for storage on servers.

Passwords cannot be stored as-is for the risk of being leaked in a case whe the database has been compromised. Hence, the passwords need to hashed to render them useless even if they are stolen.
