# Graphene OS
> A custom Operating System ROM on top of [[Android OS\|Android OS]] to modify your phone to be a Privacy fortress.

For the purpose of this note, we will separate the art from the artist i.e., we will disregard how the product is phenomenal but made by a programmer who uses autism and ADHD as excuses to be an absolute bully online.

### Why is Graphene Recommended by so many Privacy advocates?
Because as we learnt in [[Personal Online Privacy#First Step to Privacy - Compartmentalisation\|Compartmentalisation as the First Step to Online Privacy]] we saw that your life should be segregated. Now what if the OS segregated your apps into groups of profiles? A profile for google apps completely disconnected from your profile on pseudonymous social media and such.

[[Graphene OS\|Graphene OS]] can be coupled with an iPhone running Apple's latest [[iOS\|iOS]] version so that critical apps like the ones used for banking can work seamlessly (since not all apps work perfectly with Graphene OS) while stock/commercial [[Android OS\|Android OS]] should not even be on your list at all.

### Do not put a SIM card in Graphene OS phone
An advantage of using this phone as a backup which actually carries your private info without a SIM card because SIMs constantly ping cell towers for service (it is a part of how they work) and it is important that your private phone only connects to the internet with a non-public WiFi using a reputed VPN or you can choose to carry a mobile hotspot around (although that will contain a SIM but it cannot broadcast your phone's IMEI and other identifiers. If you want to use any number, use [[VoIP Numbers\|VoIP Numbers]] instead.
