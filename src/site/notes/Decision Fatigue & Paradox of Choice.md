# Decision Fatigue & Paradox of Choice
> An effect where the choices offered are so many, people tend to get overwhelmed - leading to confusion and avoiding making a decision due to the lingering [[Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO)\|Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO)]] on the choices we missed more than being satisfied with the choice that was made.

It is theorised that beyond a limit, choices really confuse people rather than help them since people start thinking about what they are loosing out on instead of what they are gaining from going with a particular choice.

### Avoidance
Narrow down the choices and make decisions based on your needs not according to the offers ahead of you - if that is not possible then always remember that "Good Enough is the optimum" in most cases since you don't see all the results of the choices you didn't make anyway. Use the [[Outcome Bias#Lessons Learnt\|Outcome Bias#Lessons Learnt]].
