# Vedic Literature
> Literature written by the Vedic Indians during the [[Indian Vedic Period\|Indian Vedic Period]]. Some works were added in the [[Late Vedic Phase\|Late Vedic Phase]] too. Also called as "Shruti" since it was transmitted orally by listening to recitations.

Vedic Literature was comprised primarily of [[Veda\|Veda]] texts called Veda because they represented a collection of knowledge they had received from Brahma, Naarada and the compositions of various Rishis (male sages) and Rishikās (female sages).

Each [[Veda\|Veda]] had 4 parts. First of which was Samhita which meant "collection".
Each Samhita has a collection of Vedic Era hymns and mantras which refer to locations, sages and gods - often praised them too.

When the Brahmins went to the forests to reflect on such things, they started to realise some philosophy that is partly spiritual and partly material. These reflections were collected down into Aranyakas. Meanwhile other brahmins needed a ritualistic interpretation for daily rituals in the [[Yajna\|Yajna]], these were named as Brahmanas.

In the Later [[Indian Vedic Period\|Vedic Period]], after the discovery of Iron at Atranjikhera, purely phillosophical interpretation of the Vedas in the form of 108 Upanishads - offering a purely spiritual way of life which resonated with the Vedic people.

Check [[Shāstras\|Shāstras]] for more information on Vedic Literature from a standpoint of faith & cultural understanding.

### Age of Vedas
Rig Veda mentions Saraswati as a massive overflowing river dubbed the "mother of floods". 
We also know that Vedas were transmitted orally by a tradition of Shruti (hearing & memorising through repeated oral pronunciation).

We now know that Vedas had to be composed well before 1800 BC (Saraswati's decline as a major river) and would not be penned down until the [[Vedic Period\|Vedic Period]] or later. 

This means that the Vedas are older than 3000 BC at the very least since the [[Indus Valley Civilsation\|Indus Valley Civilsation]] (2200 BC) shows signs of Pauranic Gods (not as popular in Vedic Literature) like [[Lord Shiva\|Lord Shiva]] in [[Pashupati Seal\|Pashupati Seal]] along with Shivalingas (which themselves are post-[[Purāṇa\|purāṇa]] creation).
