# KGB Espionage Tactics
> Note discussing everything I know & found out about Espionage Tactics used by the [[KGB\|KGB]] of [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR)\|The Soviet Union]].

The KGB always believed in having a large number of Intelligence Personnel at their service in a Target [[State (United Nations)\|State]].

As of the mid-1970s, the KGB had almost half a million personnel countrywide and almost 50,000 intelligence officers around the globe. Which was more than what the FBI and the CIA had (even if you put them together). [[KGB Espionage Tactics#^1\|#^1]]

In his book [[Books Library/The Unending Game\|The Unending Game]], the author [[Vikram Sood\|Vikram Sood]], the former Secretary of the [[R&AW\|R&AW]] from 2000 to 2003 wrote that the KGB always believed in large numbers and payments of $80,000 at the first meeting for recruiting a prospective source was nothing unheard of during the height of [[The U.S-Soviet Cold War\|The U.S-Soviet Cold War]].

The common modus-operandi of the [[KGB\|KGB]] is referred to as [[Active Measures\|Active Measures]] & requires its own note to do it justice. It is a combination of tactics that are used to collect Intelligence in any [[State (United Nations)\|State]].
