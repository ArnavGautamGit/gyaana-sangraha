# History
> Study, Analysis and Breakdown of past events to learn from them and avoid the mistakes in the future although most people do not understand the last part of why History is studied.

History is a vast subject that is barely touched up on in the world of Academics unless you are doing an actual degree/major in the subject and it is so vast infact that it can be divided on the basis of time periods, geographic location and theme.

I am sure there are other ways of breaking down and classifying such a large subject but this is one where I am sure people interested can see properly.

Most of these notes are not organised and hence not uploded here.
I apologise to any hopefuls.
