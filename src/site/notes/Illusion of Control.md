# Illusion of Control
> Tendency to believe that we can influence something over which we have absolutely no control. 

This is leveraged by various people around us.
Traffic Lights employ [[Placebo Buttons\|Placebo Buttons]] where you think the button does something but it actually does nothing.

In many offices and Hotels, Placebo Buttons are placed as dials to control the airflow from the AC vents - if they actually would work, it would cost them a lot of money (first to wire them right and then AC costs since some people would want it higher than others) so they placed these dials that are not connnected to anything - to give the illusion that they are doing something.
