# What is Judaism?
Judaism is a monothiestic, abrahamic faith of the people of Israel (Historically the Kingdoms of Israel and Judah with their respective capitals being Samaria and Jerusalem)

The consider Jerusalem as their holiest place/city due to the Ancient Temple of Jerusalem and the Second Temple (which was a rebuilt temple on the same location after the first one was destroyed.

# Roots of Judaism
Judaism has roots in a polythiestic faith of the [[Canaanite Religion\|Canaanite Religion]] where the primary God was Ä’l. One of the Gods was Yahweh who was the Canaanite God of Destruction...
As the Canaanite Religion started to go extinct, Yahweh slowly absorbed multuiple other Gods until the "Yahweh Alone" movement where early forms of Judaism took birth (also called "Yahwism" on Wikipedia similar to how Wikipedia calls Early Hinduism as "Vedic Religion" instead of Hinduism).

When the Temple was unfortunately destroyed, The practice was decentralised and prayer replaced sacrifice, and overall bad times begun until the Temple of Jerusalem was rebuilt (known as the Second Temple).

After the Temple was rebuilt, Judaism saw two off-shoots: "Second Temple Judaism" and "Samaritanism". 

# Contemporary Form of Judaism
Contemporary Jews are mainly Rabbinic Jews.
Rabbinic Judaism is the Pharisaic School of Second Temple Judaism.
Pharisaic was led by Pharisee Jews who came back from Persia, adopting many Zoroastrian elements - especially the Apocalyptic Nature of Things...
Ezekiel and Daniel and other books of Jewish Canon show the influence. It is also to be noted that since Judaism evolved out of Canaanite Religion, it shows the influence of Babylonians too (due to colonisation from the Babylonians).
