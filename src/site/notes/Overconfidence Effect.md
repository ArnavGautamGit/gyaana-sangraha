# Overconfidence Effect
> Tendency to over-estimate one's abilities, skills, value or any other attribute.

Although no source has been provided in the book, the author of the English Edition/Version of  [[Books Library/The Art of Thinking Clearly\|The Art of Thinking Clearly]], states two main things:
- Men are more likely to be Overconfident about themselves than women.
- Subject Experts are more likely to be Overconfident about their knowledge.

This effect is found in people with [[Chauffeur Knowledge\|Chauffeur Knowledge]] and can also be bred by [[Survivorship Bias\|Survivorship Bias]] since a person has been conditioned into thinking they can make it, so they also think it is easy. They underestimate the difficulty and overestimate their ability. Some may have incentive to do so intentionally - which is known as "[[Strategic Misrepresentation\|Strategic Misrepresentation]]"

### Avoidance 
1. Stay Humble.
2. Self-Awareness - be aware that you are going to over-estimate yourself.
3. Researching the baseline probability of the options.
