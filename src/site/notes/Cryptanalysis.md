# Cryptanalysis
It is defined as:
> The method of analysing any of the [[Cryptographic Encryption Algorithms\|Cryptographic Encryption Algorithms]] mathematically, logically and in any other way to try and break the encryption & retrieve the plaintext (decrypt the data) without the relevant [[Key\|Key]] nor being the intended/authorised receiver of the message.

"breaking an algorithm" can be understood as the Cryptanalyst being able to find the key and decrypt all information if they have been given the plaintext, the algrotihm (with steps) and ciphertext from the algorithm.

The process involves great knowledge and skill - almost as much knowledge as needed to create an entirely new encryption algorithm i.e., [[Cryptology\|Cryptology]].

Some simple & widely known techniques for Cryptanalysis of older Ciphers are:
1. [[Frequency Analysis\|Frequency Analysis]]
2. [[Exhaustive Key Search\|Exhaustive Key Search]]
