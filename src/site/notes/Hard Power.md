# Hard Power
> A type of [[National Power\|National Power]] where the [[State (United Nations)\|State]] relies upon [[National Power#Elements of National Power\|Tangible Elements of National Power]] such as Military or Espionage Action, Economic Sanctions & withdrawal of support or severance of diplomatic ties among other radical solutions like instigating regime change.

Hard Power was something that is often looked at as the last resort by States which prefer a Civil Discourse whereas it is seen as the first resort by those who don't. Regardless, if it goes right it can be the most effective resort

Example: The Largest Air Force of any State in the World (as of 2025) is the United States Air Force whereas the second largest Air Force is United States Navy. Both belong to the United States of America (USA) & hold around 6,000 bases around the World. USA's Annual Military Budget is also the highest by a long mile.
