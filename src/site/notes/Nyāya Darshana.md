# Nyāya Darshana
Governed by the [[Nyāyasūtra\|Nyāyasūtra]] written by [[Shri Akṣapāda Gautama\|Shri Akṣapāda Gautama]], the text relates mainly in The Science of Debate Logic (Tarka-Vidyā) and The Science of Discussion (Vāda-Vidyā) to achieve the truth.

This School of Indic Philosophy is the school which wishes to find the answer to questions using debate and discussion. This inquisitive and discussion-oriented aspect of information in this school has influenced the approach taken by [[Ādi Shankarāchārya\|Ādi Shankarāchārya]] and the approach [[Vedānta\|Vedānta]] follows even today. It influenced [[Bodha (Buddhism)\|Bodha (Buddhism)]] as Gautama Buddha is often engaging in discussion with people around him.

It can be said that it is possible that Nyāya was a contemporary (possibly even the first) of many of these philosophies.
