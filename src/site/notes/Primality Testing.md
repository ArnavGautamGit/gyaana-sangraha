# Primality Testing
> Process of testing whether a given number is a [[Prime Numbers\|Prime Number]] or not.

Primality of small numbers under 100 can be tested by checking Divisibility Rules taught in school. Checking for bigger numbers require the use of specific Primality Tests. 

> Note: *If a number fails the any Primality Test, it is a [[Composite Numbers\|composite number]], if it passes the test, the number may or may not be prime (since High Probability $\large \neq$ Proven).*

For the sake of brevity, I will avoid creation of a new note and add some Primality Tests in this note itself.

### Fermat Test
"If a number $\large n$ is prime, $\large n-1$ raised as a power to any base would yield $\large 1 \ mod \ n$."
Mathematically: $$\Large a^{n-1}=1 \ mod \ n$$It is to be noted that while 561 satisfies this test, but it has 17 as a [[Prime Factors\|Prime Factor]], meaning it is composite. Hence it is ***NOT*** 100% full-proof that any number passing these tests will definitely be [[Prime Numbers\|Prime Numbers]].
