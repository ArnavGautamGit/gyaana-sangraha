# DH Encounter Design
> More of a concern for the GM than the players but this is the part of designing sessions for the players that work well i.e., players feel challenged without feeling like this is a Dark Souls game.

It is important to note that the entire Encounter Design needs to be such that we have absolute clarity on the severity of the combat situation. We should not place a group of adversaries who are almost equal to the party's skill and power if the battle is supposed to be a small & easy skirmish that the party can brush off.

### Battle Points
[[Compendiums/Daggerheart Compendium/Daggerheart\|Daggerheart]] uses the concept of Battle Points to help the GM gauge what type, level and number of adversaries they can throw at the players without the players getting absolutely squashed by the enemies or the enemies/adversaries being strong that they squash the party like a bug.

The formula from calculating Battle Points is given below:
$$\Large Battle \ Points = (3\times S) + 2$$
here, $\large S =$ Size of Party (i.e., the total number of characters on player side)

### Example Usecase
***For Example***: if the size of the party is 3 players, we have the party's Battle Point Score as 11 by the calculation of (3x3)+2 so we can now easily run a significantly difficult encounter where we can use these 11 points to "buy" adversaries of particular battle points (like minion is 1 point, guards are 3) similar to how we buy weapons using tokens in certain game modes of FPS games such as the Search & Destroy mode in Call Of Duty. 

### Adjusting Battle Points
As mentioned before, if the fight is supposed to be a small skirmish, take some points off the Battle Points, if the entire party of players are new to TTRPGs, try and take off some battle points regardless of fight difficulty.

Like all other Daggerheart notes, this note may also require accomodation of changes after the full release of Daggerheart on 20th May.
