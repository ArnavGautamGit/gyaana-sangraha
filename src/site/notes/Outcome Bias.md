# Outcome Bias
> Tendency to judge the quality of decision-making on the basis of the outcome of the decision made rather than the process or reasons that pulled the decision-maker towards the winning choice since outcomes of the choice can be influenced by other factors or sheer luck.

### Lessons Learnt
- Never Judge a decision by how much it has benefitted you since you do not know how much the others could have benefitted or harmed you. 
	- It may be possible that if a choice helped you but it could be equaly possible that another choice sometime before or after in the timeline than this one could have helped more but you do not know that since it is very difficult to "simulate" [[Alternative Paths\|Alternative Paths]] in your brain.
	- Although "simulating" choices is hard, self reflection and [[Soliloquies\|Soliloquies]] can massively ease the decision making process and help one weighing the options.
- A bad result does not automatically indicate a bad decision and vice versa.
- There is no need to dwell on an old decision and rethinking if you should have done something else since that is the textbook example of [[Hindsight Bias\|Hindsight Bias]].

### Avoidance
- Use Rationality in making decisions & take help of [[Soliloquies\|Soliloquies]] for weighing the options
- Be detached to what life throws at you & focus only on the next move. ([[Shrimad-Bhagavad G카t훮#Quotes\|Shrimad-Bhagavad G카t훮#Quotes]])
