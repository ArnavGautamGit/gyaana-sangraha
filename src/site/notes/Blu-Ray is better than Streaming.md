# Blu-Ray is better than Streaming
It is hotly contested that if Blu-Rays are better than Streaming as a service for watching movies and TV Shows. The reality is that in terms of finance the debate is practically the same as the [[Renting vs Buying\|Renting vs Buying]] debate.

I personally feel that the quality of movies has reduced, since the movie makers do not have the "second wind" that physical disk sales provided them with & hence they try their best to make masala movies which either most Movie Industries outside Asia do not know how to do or in regions such as India where they are popular, masala movies are overdone and feel like slop.

### Streaming Services add & drop movies
It has happened many times that when Hotstar was first bought by Disney, all the movies and TV shows of theirs got moved from existing sites to their site (Disney+ Hotstar) and when they left the market in 2025, JioHotstar took their place by merger of JioCinema with Hotstar after Jio bought the service. What stops Disney to return to India with Disney+ as an independent service (which is how they exist globally)
especially as per capita income rises? All the shows and movies on JioHotstar would AGAIN move to a different service.

The current situation with Streaming Services adding, dropping or passing movies around is almost reminiscent of how in the days of the Middle Ages, the people had to adjust to the political games, wars and trade embargos played by the monarchs!

### Blu-Rays allow you to truly own a copy
Blu-Rays and DVDs or any physical medium allows one to truly own that copy of the movie or TV Show.
Does not matter if a streaming service dropped it, sold the rights to another service or whatever jazz, they cannot yoink that Disc out of the houses of every person that bought it!

They can though, pull movies and TV shows out of your catalog & out of your "Your Purchases" list on that streaming website since they have the control from the backend of the service & you are not buying a copy of the product, rather just the license to watch the product (movie, TV show or anything else).

Sony is infamous of doing this in their PlayStation Now service, Amazon has done it on the Kindle where your "downloaded" books were removed by them since they lost the rights. Not to mention, the downloads where the product hogs up space on your device but cannot be viewed outside of the service i.e., DRM-locked downloads are not even really downloading something because it only grants you the license to view the product offline, not actually download a copy for free use.

### Ever Increasing Streaming Sites
Many people point out how one could just shuffle the streaming services on a monthly or quarterly basis since they realise that each service has only one real big release that almost everyone likes to watch. That idea is not as easy anymore since there are new streaming services being added every year in an industry which already has too many of them competing against one another! First there was Netflix & Prime Video, then came Hotstar, then came Zee5, SonyLIV and stuff has gotten so massive that even sports like MotoGP, NBA & F1 got their own streaming services now! Gone are the days when one could watch all sports on the same 4 or 5 TV channels.

### Sports Streaming is here to stay, unless...
Unless we move to TV again, but even Cable takes money & it is more often than not a lot more money than Streaming that is also paid every month to be able to get a viewing experience.
So it is better to save up on not paying for streaming movies or shows each month & better spend that money on sports instead. Pirated Streams are generally in really bad quality.

### Blu-Rays often offer more!
Blu-Rays often come with longer, extended versions when compared to Theatrical Release. To watch the same extended version one may have to buy the Disc or scour through YouTube where you (most likely) won't find anything until a good time has passed from the release of the Extended Cut Blu-Ray.

Some Blu-Rays may include these extra scenes as a part of the movie, others may include it as a separate disc in 2-Disc Variants! Generally it is included as 2-discs.

### Blu-Rays MIGHT save you money
Instead of paying aroung 500 Rupees EVERY MONTH to get a sizably inferior quality, rather pay Rs. 2000 ONCE and get an authentic Blu-Ray of a movie. If one does not have a PlayStation or Xbox console, you may have to spend around 20-30k on a new region-free Blu-Ray player, used may be cheaper. The only downside to using a console for viewing is that consoles will be region-locked. While Newer Blu-Rays may be expensive, Blu-Rays of older movies are available for as low as Rs. 750. 

1. Detective Pikachu's Blu-Ray was selling for Rs. 750 on Amazon India in May 2025.
2. Deadpool's first movie's Blu-Ray was selling for 890 on Amazon India in the same timeframe. Some Reviewers claim to have bought it for 399 in the Reviews!
3. Deadpool 2 was selling for 690 (non-Super Duper Cut versions for both i.e., no extra scenes)

Blu-Rays regularly bundle as "Lord of The Rings Trilogy" or "The Matrix Trilogy" for around Rs. 3000 i.e., 1000 per movie.

For more savings, DVD is great! It is still better quality than Streaming (if you compare it with cheaper plans). As an example, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse sells for 1200 in Blu-Ray and 500 in DVD!
