# Hourly Pay encourages Inefficiency
> Hourly Pay is defined as a system where workers are paid by the hour. It is very popular in the Freelancing Space.

The arguements against it is simple: The worker can easily take 8 hours instead of 4 to do the same thing & still get paid more since this system prioritises the amount or *quantity* of time. instead of the *quality* of the same i.e., no one cares if you efficiently used the time that was quoted by you or slacking off for half of it.
