# Jyotisha
> Important subject in [[Vedāṇga\|Vedāṇga]] which helps predicting a person's life.

It is claimed that Celestial Bodies in Astronomy (called [[Graha (ग्रह)\|Graha (ग्रह)]]) along with bodies as described in the [[Shāstras\|Shāstras]] such as [[Rāhu\|Rāhu]] and [[Ketu\|Ketu]] can affect the human body. Whether one believes so or not, that is another thing entirely - I was curious about this knowledge - not that I necessarily believe in it.

To keep notes separate from Astronomy, I will use Sanskrit names for Constellations and Planets while I use English Names for Astronomy i.e., I will name the Astrology note as [[Shani (शनि)\|Shani (शनि)]] while I name the Astronomy note about the planet as [[Saturn\|Saturn]].

Topics that we learn about:
[[Houses in the Kundali\|Houses in the Kundali]]
[[Lagna (लग्न)\|Lagna (लग्न)]]
[[Nakshatra (नक्षत्र)\|Nakshatra (नक्षत्र)]]
[[Graha (ग्रह) as Rāshi Lords\|Graha (ग्रह) as Rāshi Lords]]
