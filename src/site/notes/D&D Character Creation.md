# D&D Character Creation
> The part of [[Compendiums/D&D Compendium/Dungeons & Dragons\|Dungeons & Dragons]] that is most fun - Character Creation! This is the base of the game for the player side of the fun!

D&D Characters have a Name, [[D&D Character Classes\|Class]], [[D&D Character Backgrounds\|Background]], [[D&D Ancestries\|Ancestry]] (also called Race/Species). These form the base of your character which makes your character unique in the party. Apart from this Characters also have mechanical elements like Level, Ability Scores, Spells (if a spellcaster) but these things keep changing with time. It is recommended that all the non-mechanical elements are written with a pencil or frequently erasable ink when making physical character sheets. 

## Should I show up with my character pre-made?
Depends entirely on you and the [[Dungeon Master (DM)\|Dungeon Master (DM)]]!
Each DM has a different rule and many DMs have different takes on whether characters should be made on [[Compendiums/Daggerheart Compendium/Safety Tools/Session Zero\|Session Zero]] or made individually and kept a surprise.

Each DM has a different tradition depending upon the campaign - many like the initiative but it is best if you do not finalise your character's backstory unilaterally even if you have the basic character creation done. 
Communication is key and involving more people is more fun for everyone! It also makes for better roleplay that people are more familiar with your character if you made it or brainstormed it with them in the [[Compendiums/Daggerheart Compendium/Safety Tools/Session Zero\|Session Zero]]!

## Character Creation Process
The first step in character creation is to get an idea into what kind of character do you want to play, chances are players already have an idea of if they want to play a specific [[D&D Ancestries\|Ancestry]]. If one has absolutely zero idea, then the Chapter 2 of [[Compendiums/D&D Compendium/Corebooks/D&D Player's Handbook\|D&D Player's Handbook]] recommends that one selects their Class followed by a combo of Background & Ancestry on the basis of interest (you wanted to play it) or on the basis of mechanics (it complements or optimises your class)

In case you have no idea about [[D&D Character Classes\|D&D Character Classes]], use the common archetypes like Wizards being intelligent, witty people who love some books (Am I an IRL wizard then? idk)
Be sure to put a slight spin on the characters or do whatever really to spice up the characters.
You should also try and get a balanced party where it is a diverse ensemble of characters which every character having unique abilities that can shine depending upon the situation.

Note your armour training and hold your thought for a while until you select your [[D&D Character Backgrounds\|Background]] and [[D&D Ancestries\|Ancestry]] & confirm if the armour training had any new additions, the amount cannot be reduced, you can only add to it.

Imagine your past & present, choose your languages and all that good stuff.
Ability Scores depend on what your class favours - so focus on strength and dexterity for Fighter or Barbarian class and so on. This is where I prefer using the page 38 of [[Compendiums/D&D Compendium/Corebooks/D&D Player's Handbook\|D&D PHB]] or just refer the player towards D&D Beyond.

Once you've assigned your ability scores, give some thought to what those scores might say about your character's appearance and personality. A very strong character with low Charisma might look and behave differently from a charismatic character with low Strength. The fol lowing tables of descriptive words give suggestions of how you might describe your character based on having a high or low score in an ability. Conversely players that have an idea about the character personality & looks often have a slight harder time to balance ability scores that best reflect the characters vs mechanically strong characters.

Fill in other details like Class Features, Skill Proficiencies, Saving Throws, Allignment etc.

$$\Large \text{Passive Perception} = 10 + \text{Perception Check Bonus}$$
$$\Large \text{Melee Attack Bonus} = \text{Strength Mod} + \text{Proficiency Bonus}$$
$$\Large \text{Ranged Attack Bonus} = \text{Dexterity Mod} + \text{Proficiency Bonus}$$
$$\Large \text{Spell Save DC} = 8 + \text{Proficiency Bonus}$$
$$\Large \text{Spell Attack Bonus} = \text{Spellcasting Mod} + \text{Proficiency Bonus}$$
