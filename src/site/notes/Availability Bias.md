# Availability Bias
> Tendency to create an opinion about something with whatever little information we know about the subject. Regardless of if the information being used as a basis is correct or reflective or the full picture.

The bias stems from the saying, "Something is better than Nothing".
Although the saying is not wrong but using the *something* to brew up the rest and living in the delusion that you know *everything* is the epitome of stupidity. 

The old saying may be right on its part that "Something is better than Nothing" but the hopeful saying turns into bias when you start to prefer the half-done and half-assumed, wrong map over the right one.

### Avoidance
To overcome the Availability Bias, keep learning and seek opinions of other people - preferably those who know more than you about a topic.
