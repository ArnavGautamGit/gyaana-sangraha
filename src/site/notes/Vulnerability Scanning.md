# Vulnerability Scanning
> Process of identifying existing [[Cyber Security Terminology#Vulnerabilities\|vulnerabilities]] and weaknesses of a system or network in order to determine how a system can be exploited. It is most often used with automated tools that can perform this process automatically.

There are many tools used to figure out these vulnerabilities and many are listed below. Although most of the tools refer to the [[OWASP Top-10\|OWASP Top-10]], [[CWE Top-25\|CWE Top-25]], [[CVE Top-25\|CVE Top-25]] and similar lists as sources. 

### How they work
Vuln-Scanning tools generally store the data from year to year including storing statistics regarding how common these are and when the user tells it to scan given codebase, it either scans for the most critical vulnerabilities first or the most common vulnerabilities first. Good platforms often provide a choice.

### Tools Used
The list will get too long if we try to write down all the tools available hence the following tools listed are those taught to us in College in the course: [[Ethical Hacking & Prevention\|Ethical Hacking & Prevention]].
- Nessus
- GFI LanGuard
- Nikto
- Retina CS
- SAINT
- [[Zero-Attack Proxy (ZAP)\|ZAP]]
