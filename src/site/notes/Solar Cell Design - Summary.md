# What is Solar Cell Design - Summary?
- Solar Cells need to be made using either Silicon for land-based Solar Cells or an alloy of Cadmium-Tellurium for single-junction or Space Applications!
- Solar Cells must be covered on the frint with Glass, with some form of [[Solar Cell Design - Energy Loss#Method 1 Anti-Reflection Coatings (ARCs)\|Anti-Reflection Coatings]] to avoid reflection off the glass surface. To seal the glass, Ethylene Vinyl Acetate is placed and then the Solar Cell is laminated (heated at 80-100 degree Celsius) to melt the EVA - followed by curing at 180-200 degrees Celsius and attached with ETF (called Tedlar) on the back of the cell to protect its back
- Solar Cells must always be made keeping in mind all the Energy Losses.
- Solar Cells are connected in series in a panel or module (use Bypass Diodes for every 10-15 cells to prevent hospots & heating issues). A panel must be able to charge 12V battery on its own, hence 36 panels seems to be good to produce 20-22 Volts in theory (around 13-16V in practical applications - still good enough to charge 12V battery).
- Panels are connected in parallel (or a mix of series and parallel) to form Solar Arrays.
