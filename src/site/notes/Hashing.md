# Hashing
> Process of using One-Way Mathematical Functions (known as "Hashing Functions") that cannot be reversed and produce a fixed Length Output for providing [[Integrity\|Integrity]].

In an ideal case, we want it to be [[Collision\|Collision]]-proof but in reality we have only been able to make them [[Collision-Resistant\|Collision-Resistant]].

There are many Hashing Functions used in the modern world - like [[MD5\|MD5]], [[HMAC\|HMAC]], [[SHA-1\|SHA-1]] and the current standard: [[SHA-3\|SHA-3]].
