# Nāstika Philosophies 
Nāstika Philosophies do not believe in the Vedas to be authentic.
"Nāstika" in Sanskrit means "Atheist" although... here it is not used in the same context as it is used in the West. 

Some of these philosophies do not believe that God exists and hence deny the Vedas but they do believe in Enlightnement (like [[Bodha (Buddhism)\|Bodha (Buddhism)]] and [[Jaina(Jainism)\|Jaina(Jainism)]])

Others like [[Charvaka\|Charvaka]] couldn't care about the Vedas and called them with horrific names yet they were still considered Hindus/Sanatanis since they had civilised disagreements. No matter how foul the language may be to express the same, but the never desacrated temples or idols.
