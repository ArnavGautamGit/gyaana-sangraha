# Survivorship Bias
> Tendency to over-estimate one's ability or chancessince triumph is more visible than failures in the media.

For every one musician that made it, there are 10,000 who did not. (Here made it means generating a stable income enough as at least a side job if not the main one).

Since Journalists cannot possibly look through that sea and keep bringing us the information of failed musicians (except superstars who later disappeared) and since it is much easier to find out information about successful musicians, it is natural that the common folk only see the success stories around them for any field - which breeds [[Confirmation Bias\|Confirmation Bias]] and the [[Overconfidence Effect\|Overconfidence Effect]] that everything will be alright and they know all they need to.

### Avoidance
It is important to note that we must need to look at probabilities of things happening instead of looking at things emotionally. 

### Similar
These are the following biases and fallacies that may make us over-estimate Probability except Survivorship Bias:
[[False Causality\|False Causality]] and Swimmer's Body Illusion
[[Social Proof\|Social Proof]]
