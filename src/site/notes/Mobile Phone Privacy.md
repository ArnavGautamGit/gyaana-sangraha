# Mobile Phone Privacy
> Maintaining [[Personal Online Privacy\|Personal Online Privacy]] on your Mobile Phone so that you can rest assured to not be able to be tracked much.

I will assume you have taken all steps discussed in the [[Personal Online Privacy\|Personal Online Privacy]] note along with the extra tips written at the bottom. I would also recommend following all of them.

### Privacy Screen Protector
Some of them come in the form of a full front & back cover but I feel I can get a much better option. Get one of those which offer it as a tempered glass which is tinted or polarised or both. It allows you to use specific back cover discussed ahead

### Back Cover with Camera Protector
Those ones that have a slider which covers the area over the back camera so that background apps cannot use your phone's back camera to spy on you since all that sees is a black screen.

### Front Camera Cover
There are many packs of 3 or packs of 6 stick-on covers that are sold on as cheap as 1 USD or 99 INR on many online retailers as soon as you type "webcam blocker" or "webcam cover" in their search bar you will see them in the 100s.

### Mic Blocker or Faraday Cage Bag
If your phone has a 3.5 mm headphone jack in it, it is a great idea to instead of buying those 3.5 mm mic blockers specifically, it is easier to get those 3.5mm to 6.5mm adapters and then just connect the empty adapter to the 3.5 mm jack on your phone. Although, I have not tested it, the empty adapter trick should theoretically work... 
3.5mm mic blockers are at least more full proof & reassuring. 

If you want something more substantial in case your phone uses Type C with no headphone jack then you can opt for Faraday Bags that are obviously the best bet but you would not be able to use the screen either.

### Stop using Android OS
[[Android OS\|Android OS]] is a dumpsterfire of surveillance. Apple at least makes basic things such as encrypting your cloud backups via Advanced Data Protection into a toggle switch. Similarly Lockdown Mode (that can protect you against Nation-State actors) is also a toggle.

Best is to use a Google Pixel to load a custom ROM like [[Graphene OS\|Graphene OS]] on it.
Followed by Apple's [[iOS\|iOS]] and Android should not even be on your list.

### Reboot your phone more often
PIN is stored on RAM after first unlock to make unlocks faster. Reboots wipe the RAM memory and the data inside (specifically clicking "shut down" instead of "restart").

### Use Airplane Mode
Blocks SIM service & SIM-based location tracking.

### Use a private navigation service
One that uses OpenStreetMap API like OsmAnd and Organic Maps or similar maps.
