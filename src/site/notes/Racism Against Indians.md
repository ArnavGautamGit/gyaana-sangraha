# Racism against Indians in South Korea
## ***Example 1***: Redice Studios & Manhwa
Redice Studios - the biggest name in Manhwa business and the creators of the famous Manhwa "Solo Levelling" (which also became a show later) released a new manhwa named "Regressing with the Kingâ€™s Power". If you are going to read Chapter 27 of that Manhwa, if you are Indian you will find it disturbing to say the least.
The villain of the story is of Indian Origin who is named "Narandra Neru", there is no need to explain that the name is derived from two of India's Prime Ministers i.e., the current PM when this comic has released (Mr. Narendra Modi) and the first-ever PM of Independent India (Jawaharlal Nehru).
Where the first name is taken from the current PM, the last name is taken from the first PM of Independent India.
This is not disturbing news, the disturbing news is the fact that this character is not only a villain but runs a Terrorist Organisation which conducts terror attacks that look eerily similar to 9/11 (which did not even involve Indians by the way).

This is not the first time Redice Studios have done something similar to/about Indians. It is a regular occurance and they are habitual repeat offenders of this. Redice themselves have done this before, in one of the chapters of their manhwa named "Solo-Max Level Newbie", they had this weird segment involving two Indian Characters named "Chandra" and "Arun" and the main character of the Manhwa comic made them run semi-naked in Seoul, and its news was shown on TV that thos two characters got arrested.

## Example 2: Road Signs of "Indians not allowed" all around Seuol
I don't even care to spell the city's name correctly at this point where Indians are treated with similar sign boards from the British Colonial times in 2023 in another country which was formerly colonised. Please don't try to whitewash this as something like "protecting your culture against foreigners" since that does not work... Your neighbouring Japan does not do this.
Japan is much more civil than that. They dis-allow all non-Japanese in certain parts yes, but not specify individual races/nationalities like this to make them feel specifically targeted.
