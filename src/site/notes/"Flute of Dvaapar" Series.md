# "Flute of Dvaapar" Part 1
I had the idea of a game series which is very similar to an amalgamation of Game of Thrones, Young Samurai and Percy Jackson into a singular story set in the Mahābhārata era - parallel to the original story.

The "Flute" in the title reflects Krishna's Flute and the main character's absolute resolve to learn how to play the flute from Krishna himself - going to the extent of gifting Krishna another flute when he learns that Krishna left playing the flute after he left it in Vrindavan (it is not mentioned specifically, but it is a hint to a folktale that Krishna left his flute to Radha in Vrindavan before he departed to Mathura to kill Kansa). 

The "flute" also refers to the Sanskrit word "Laya" which is the opposite of "Pralaya" which will be the final game in the series after "Flute of Dvaapar" Part 2 and future spin-offs.
On the other hand, "Dvaapar" refers to the Dvaapar Yuga - the Yuga where Mahābhārata took place.

### The Build
The game will be built using [[Ren'Py\|Ren'Py]]. The idea is to use Voiceovers instead of lines and move the images quickly with dialogue to give the illusion of a motion comic.

### The Plot
The game is a two-part game that is set along parallel to the Mahābhārata that tells the story of a young kid Vimukt who is born to the Gautama gotra, in close relation to Kripācharya. Making him a distant younger cousin of Ashwatthāmā.

Not much is known about his mother but she is from the Jamdagni gotra (Parshurāma's descendent). Parshurāma himself named him Vimukt after he saw the child - Vimukt is a name used for Shiva in his meditative state - it means "Especially Liberated" referring to Spiritual Liberation and detachment.

The kid being a member of the aristocratic society of Hastinapur and surrounding regions is poised to be a valuable diplomat or strategist when he grows up. The family has to move from Hastinapur to Mathura when tensions rise between the Pandavas and Kauravas and then later to Dwarka during the Yadava Migration. 

Still to train young Vimukt for the same diplomat/strategist career, he and his elder cousin brother are both to be sent to Greece under his father and uncle respectively via two ships on the advice of Krishna when they met after the XYZ event in Hastinapur of the original when Krishna returned to Dwarka. (XYZ event is an unknown event in Hatinapur in the original Mahābhārata which specific event this is going to be best suited to be in the game's story by re-checking the character ages & timelines in the original text)

During the journey, a storm in the Gulf of Dwarka (today's Arabian Sea) creates some distance between the two ships - or so it seems...
The trailing ship which carried the young Vimukt and his family gets attacked by the raiders/pirates from "The Desert" (i.e., Arabia) and the attack leads to the death of most of Vimukt's family members including both his parents although Vimukt is hiding in the ship's hull holding the piece of [[The Divine Metal\|The Divine Metal]] given to them by Krishna and Dwarka's temple authorities while chanting the Shiva Raksha Stotram.

The damaged ship drifts off course & crash lands in feudal Egypt - where the first pharoah-to-be, Rameses I takes Vimukt as an adoptive son. He trains as a warrior there (combining his knowledge from Guru Dronācharya - including Divya-Astras - with what he learnt in Egypt). After the training is complete, he creates a sword of his own (according to the tradition of Egypt) using [[The Divine Metal\|The Divine Metal]]. He then learns that the Divine Metal allows him to directly converse with God Shiva since he accidentally - even if in fear - invoked the Shiva Raksha Stotram in it - meaning God Shiva, via the sword is vowed to defend him as long as he (Vimukt) follows the path of Dharma.

Part - 2 deals with the [[Unification of Ancient Egypt\|Unification of Ancient Egypt]] and Vimukt's subsequent return to Bhārat.
