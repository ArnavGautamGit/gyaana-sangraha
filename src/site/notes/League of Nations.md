# League of Nations
> It was a [[Collective Security\|Collective Security]] Framework created after [[The First World War (WW1)\|The Great War]] to make sure that such Wars do not happen again. Unfortunately, it failed upholding its objective and [[The Second World War (WW2)\|The Second World War (WW2)]] could not be stopped.

League of Nations was adopted on 10 January 1920 after being proposed in the Paris Peace Conference and it also enforced the [[Treaty of Versailles (1919)\|Treaty of Versailles (1919)]] . The League believed in settling issues with diplomacy and arbitration, disarmament and prevention of wars.

### Proposal
The idea of the League was promoted and proposed by the USA and the UK, the former themselves did not join the League. In fact, the League only had 58 members at its peak (total 63 states that were a member at some time or another) which is abysmally small when compared to 191 members and 2 observers of the [[United Nations (U.N)\|United Nations (U.N)]].

### Structure
The League of Nations had a general assembly and a council. The Council was a group of States which contained Permanent Members who would be the ones to enforce the rules of the League across all its members. The League does not hold its own military.

It had the Permanent Court of International Justice which was a court where states could move cases against other states for violating the covenant.

The League need unanimous decisions and no voting was entertained. Decisions were not pronounced and the legislations were not passed until an absolute consensus was reached. This was a step back from local parliaments of many of the members such as the UK which allowed voting in case consesus is not reached.

The League had many other organs like The Mandates Commission, International Commission on Intellectual Cooperation and the Permanent Central Opium Board among others.

## Failures of The League
It is no hidden secret that the League was unable to stop [[The Second World War (WW2)\|The Second World War (WW2)]] and hence failed its objective. We must examine its failures to learn from them.
These failures include but are not limited to:
[[League of Nations#Lack of Voting & Inability to Act\|#Lack of Voting & Inability to Act]]
[[League of Nations#Failure to Ban Chemical Weapons and Constant Disagreements\|#Failure to Ban Chemical Weapons and Constant Disagreements]]
[[League of Nations#Treaty of Mutual Assistance (1923) & Geneva Protocol (1924)\|#Treaty of Mutual Assistance (1923) & Geneva Protocol (1924)]]
[[League of Nations#No Economic Help to Struggling Members\|#No Economic Help to Struggling Members]]
[[League of Nations#Perception of being biased\|#Perception of being biased]]

#### Lack of Voting & Inability to Act
It was a part of the structure of the League that all decisions will be made by arriving on a consensus and a unanimous decision is necessary to arrive at a decision else the motion or proposal will forever sit in the pipeline as a proposal & never be enacted.
Member States who wanted to re-arm could easily do so and disagree in any assembly or council meetings leading to a disguised anarchical system which is still as anarchic but less overtly anarchic.
In 1933, Japan simply withdrew from the League despite being a permanent member in the Council rather than submit to its judgement, as did Germany the same year (using the failure of the World Disarmament Conference to agree to arms parity between France and Germany as a pretext), Italy in 1937, and Spain in 1939. The final significant act of the League was to expel the Soviet Union in December 1939 after [Soviet Invasion of Finland in the Winter War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_War "Winter War").

#### Failure to Ban Chemical Weapons and Constant Disagreements
In 1921, it set up the Temporary Mixed Commission on Armaments to explore possibilities for disarmament. It was made up not of government representatives but of famous individuals. They rarely agreed. Proposals ranged from abolishing [chemical warfare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_warfare "Chemical warfare") and [strategic bombing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_bombing "Strategic bombing") to the limitation of more conventional weapons, such as tanks

#### Treaty of Mutual Assistance (1923) & Geneva Protocol (1924)
The 1923 Draft Treaty of Mutual Assistance was an unsuccessful proposal made by the League of Nations to address the issue of disarmament and security in Europe after World War I. It was rejected by the British government in 1924 and was never adopted. The Draft Treaty was an early attempt by the League to create a system of collective security and disarmament, leading the League to pursue alternative approaches that also ultimately failed to gain traction
The "Geneva Protocol for the Pacific Settlement of International Disputes" was a proposal by British Prime Minister [Ramsay MacDonald](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramsay_MacDonald "Ramsay MacDonald") and his French counterpart [Édouard Herriot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89douard_Herriot "Édouard Herriot"). It set up compulsory arbitration of disputes and created a method to determine the aggressor in international conflicts. All legal disputes between nations would be submitted to the World Court. It called for a disarmament conference in 1925. Any government that refused to comply in a dispute would be named an aggressor. Any victim of aggression was to receive immediate assistance from League members.
British Conservatives condemned the proposal for fear that it would lead to conflict with the United States, which also opposed the proposal. The British Dominions strongly opposed it. The Conservatives came to power in Britain and in March 1925 the proposal was shelved and never reintroduced.

#### No Economic Help to Struggling Members
The big reason to the rise of [[Fascism\|Fascism]] was able to rise was the inability of League of Nations to help other members and increase cooperation during [[The Great Depression (1930s)\|The Great Depression (1930s)]] and the simultaneous Wall Street Crash. The Fascists proposed that their one leader is the one and only solution to all their economic and military problems and will make their state great again.

#### Perception of being biased
Since the league was proposed by the Victors of [[The First World War (WW1)\|WW1 (1914-1918)]], it was seen as the "League of Victors" hence making other members feel alienated & more prone to rebel and oppose decisions since the victors held the council. Since there is a [[League of Nations#Lack of Voting & Inability to Act\|Lack of Voting]] in the League, it becomes easier for them to delay or completely hang any observances of the League. This same weakness is also seen in the present [[United Nations (U.N)\|United Nations (U.N)]] since the ststes who won [[The Second World War (WW2)\|WW2]] are a part of the [[United Nations Security Council (U.N.S.C)\|United Nations Security Council (U.N.S.C)]] except the UN believes in Voting but also allows the "victors" to veto any decision.
