# Constitution of India
> The word ‘Constitution’ is developed from the word ‘Constitute’, which means ‘to frame or to establish or to compose’. In the context of a country or [[State (United Nations)\|UN Member State]] such as India, it refers to a document which codifies the soul of the country as the law of its land. 

The Indian Constitution is an important instrument which confers powers, rights, functions, principles, restrictions and obligations on the part of individuals, states and everybody who are the citizens of India. 

The purpose of the Constitution is to maintain harmonious relations between both the individuals and the state and between the different organs of the state among each other.

I also studied this subject as an audit course (zero credit course) during my bachelor's degree in [[Computer Science (CompSci)\|Computer Science Engineering]] from Jaypee Institute of Information Technology, Noida.
Notes from those classes are sparse and few. Most notes come from when I studiedthe subject "[[Indian Polity & Governance\|Indian Polity]]" when preparing for [[UPSC Civil Services Exam\|UPSC CSE 2026]].
