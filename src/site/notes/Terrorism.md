# Terrorism
> Defined as the act of using, leveraging and spreading terror to arm-twist certain stakeholders of a particular [[State (United Nations)\|State's]] government or a group of States to agree to their terms of mainstreaming their radical agendas or something much worse.

The United States of America and the First World in general initially considered Terrorism as an internal security issue as they themselves funded such separatist groups which were considered terrorists as a leverage on the newly independent states & to divert the attention of [[Warsaw Pact\|Second World States]] and their stance remained the same until the [[9/11 Terrorist Attack\|9/11 Terrorist Attack]] which opened the eyes of the First World so they could see what they created & funded.
{see: [[Terrorism#^1\|1]], [[Terrorism#^2\|2]]}

Acts of Terrorism are referred to as Terrorist Attacks. While perpetrators of these acts are known as Terrorists.

### Different from Political Violence
Terrorism is often considered a weapon of the weak & must be kept separate from [[Political Violence\|Political Violence]]. Where Political Violence involves taking support of like minded civilians and often does NOT involve attacks on civilians and tourists, Terrorism aims to create terror & may attack tourists and civilians if it means furthering their [[Nihilism\|Nihilist]] thought process.
Example: You will never see or hear about any [[Naxalism\|Naxals]] killing Civilians, we only hear of Naxals attacking the CRPF jawans. Terrorists have a long history of killing civilians from [[Paris Charlie-Hebdo Terrorist Violence\|Paris Charlie-Hebdo Terrorist Violence]] [[9/11 Terrorist Attack\|9/11 Terrorist Attack]] and most recently the [[Pahalgam Terror Attack\|Pahalgam Terror Attack]].

In summary,
Political Violence is the situation where thought-leaders have to take up arms SOLELY against their political opponents (not civilians) & attempt to become popular in the masses to topple their political opponents in power.
Terrorism is killing blindly to cause chaos, in hopes that one day either your mission is achieved or the opponents cave in & offer a deal to mainstream radicalism. There are only few areas like Palestine where the two coincide but Hamas is still considered Terrorists due to their methods being cruel & inhuman (like Microwaving a Baby).

### Different from Guerilla Warfare
[[Guerilla Warfare\|Guerilla Warfare]] is a tactic in War where smaller armies use environmental & geographic cover to suddenly attack (i.e., [[Ambush\|Ambush]]) enemy troops, there is often the element of mastery over the local geography & location's features.

Although some terrorists may use these tactics, in the end not all guerilla warriors are terrorists and not all terrorists use guerilla warfare since it used to reduce casualties but Terrorists do not operatre in groups larger than 4.

### Terrorism as a Political Tool
Terrorism is often nowadays defended by some claiming it is a crueller form of [[Political Violence\|Political Violence]]. As stated before in this note in the example for Hamas, the supporters of Palestine would claim they are Guerilla Warriors fighting as Political Opponents to the Israeli Government. 

Although I personally disagree with this sentiment since the people "defending a cause" do not launch an attack into another state "pre-emptively" (like 7th October) but there is no denying it receives funds, ammunition & supplies from Iran - so does Hezbollah i.e., they get used as political tools of enemy [[State (United Nations)\|States]] anyway.

# Footnotes
1. America funded the Mujahedeen & it became the Taliban. Mujahed & talib mean the same word (student) since they used Mujaheds & Talibs as their primary target for indoctrination & brainwashing.
2. Terrorism in Kashmir was often referred to as a "Law & Order Issue" by the Americans & the First World and they still run the narrative of an Independent Kashmir that got stifled by both the sides.
