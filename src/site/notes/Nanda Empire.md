# Nanda Empire
> The note detailing the history of Nanda Empire from somewhere around 400 BC to 321 BC.

After the period of [[Indian Vedic Period\|Vedic Period]] History when the [[Rise of Magadha\|Rise of Magadha]] occured, the ruler named [[Mahapadma Nanda\|Mahapadma Nanda]] decided to conquer multiple mahajanapads after Magadha had already captured the largest of them all Avanti & the prosperous Chhedi already!

The Kuru & Panċāla mahajanpads were the most populous & rich in agrarian produce, trade and considered as such - the most powerful in terms of military and money. By the time the first Nanda ruler retired, the Nandas controlled all of Northern & Central India.

### Major Rulers
1. [[Mahapadma Nanda\|Mahapadma Nanda]]
2. [[Dhana Nanda\|Dhana Nanda]] (until 321 BC)

The [[Purāṇa\|Purāṇa]] and [[Jaina Philosophy (Jainism)\|Jaina]] writings claim other rulers between them but the list varies too much to write & I do not trust historians like Irfan Habib and Romila Thapar who claim to be experts without knowing [[Sanskrit\|Sanskrit]].

### Dhana Nanda, Alexander & the following decline
Greek Writers of the time wrote that while Alexander was able to reach India, he was faced by a massive kingdom ([[Nanda Empire\|Nanda Empire]]) which had a military five times the size of Alexander's and while the Macedonian army was tired after successive campaigns, Nanda soldiers were ready for them after Alexnader's battle with Porus ended as a seeming Stalemate/Loss. 

It is said that [[Alexander The Great\|Alexander The Great]] (who controlled the Punjab and Thar desert along with some Gujarati regions to the west of the [[Aravali Hills\|Aravali Hills]]) could not fight the Nandas & we could have won back our territory but a King like [[Dhana Nanda\|Dhana Nanda]] born in Royalty would not want to - due to having no connect with the people he rules over and not being concerned with what is not seen by him as an "imminent person".

It is also said that [[Dhana Nanda\|Dhana Nanda]] signing a peace pact with [[Alexander The Great\|Alexander The Great]] did not go down nicely with [[Vishnugupta Chanakya\|Vishnugupta Chanakya]] (a professor of Economics at [[Takshila University\|Takshila University]]) since he thought that the Nanda Empire left a major site of Indian Culture under the influence of greeks and the ancient university of Takshila is now at the mercy of outsiders. Chanakya did raise this point in Dhana Nanda's court and instead got humiliated, assaulted and dragged out of court by his [[Shikhā\|Shikhā]]. This is where Chanakya decided that he will posit on the throne a suitable king who will kick out the Greeks & push back [[Selucus I Nicator\|Selucus I Nicator]] off the Indian subcontinent.
