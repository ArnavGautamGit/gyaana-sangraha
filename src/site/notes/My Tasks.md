# My Tasks
> Note gathering all my tasks that I need to finish.

The fact that Obsidian Bases cannot be rendered by the Digital Garden Plugin I use to backup my notes to GitHub means that this entire table of tasks below will be invisible to those using the website to view my notes i.e., my privacy is preserved.

The reason I use Bases is for the increased loading speed over the Dataview Plugin & the various views in the same base that I can get & switch between on the fly as I wish. The Privacy bit also helps quite a lot.
