# Prime Numbers
> [[Whole Numbers\|Whole Numbers]] that have no [[Factors\|Factors]] except 1 and the number itself, is known as a Prime Number. In other words, numbers that are not divisble by any numbers other than 1 and the number itself.

[[Whole Numbers\|Whole Numbers]] that do not fit the definition of Prime Numbers are called "Composite Numbers" since they are composed as a multiple of various Prime Numbers. It is important to note that the number "1" is considered neither prime nor composite.

### Things to Remember
- 2 is the only even positive Prime Number.
- 3, 5 and 7 is the only group of Consecutive Prime Numbers
- There are a total of 9 Prime Numbers from 1 to 25 and 6 Primes from 25 to 50.
- 25 Primes in 1-100.
- 46 Primes in 1-200.
- 62 Primes in 1-300.
- 78 Primes in 1-400.
- 95 Primes in 1-500.

### Need for Primality Testing
For smaller numbers under 100 or under 50, testing for Prime Numbers is easy by using a variety of divisiblity tests to check if the number is divisible by 2, 3, 5, etc.
But for big Prime Numbers such as the ones used for the [[RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adelman)\|RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adelman)]] require [[Primality Testing\|Primality Testing]] to check if they are actually Prime or not.
