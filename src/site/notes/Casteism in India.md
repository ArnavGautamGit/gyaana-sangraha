# Casteism in India (Perception vs Reality)
> There is a lot of misconceptions on the internet about how the Caste System in India worked and if it existed in the same form people talk about it. This is a note that aims to separate the perception and the reality.

If you think India has Casteism you need to know that Hinduism has Castes based on a person's Karma, Occupation and Sanskāra (संस्कार).

### Castes were based on Karma (Behaviour) and Sanskāras (Rituals)
At Birth, everyone is considered a Shudra/Śudra.
According to thier Karma and the number of Sanskāras (Rituals) they have perfomed out of the total of 15 (16th one is a funeral) - they attain a caste over their lifetime. As long as their families follow the same path as their ancestors, they are still considered to be of the same caste and this is where the issue begins. Anyway, let's first look at the details first.

No caste is higher or lower.

There are 16 Sanskāras in Hinduism. The list is given below.
1. ==गर्भाधान== - Analysis of Mental and Physical Health of the couple - done before Sex
2. ==पुंसवन== - Pregnant women were fed soup/juice of some Ayurvedic Medicinal herbs - like Lakshmaṇa, Sahdevi etc. - done 2 to 3 months after Pregnancy confirmation 
3. ==सीमान्तोन्नयन== - done after 6 months of Pregnancy, Ancient Baby Shower - the husband grooms the wife's hair as the guests bring gifts.
4. ==जातकर्म== - At the time of Birth, the father when holding the baby for the first time would chant mantras for their longetivity in their ears. Astrological Chart/Kundali was made for the kid as well. 
5. ==नामकरण== - Name for the Child would be decided on the basis of their Nakshatra and Kundali (done after 10 days of birth)
6. ==निष्क्रमण== - 3 to 4 months after birth, the kid was taken out into the Sun and shown the world by explaining the meaning of all elements. First Puja and Devi-Devata Darshan as well.
7. ==अन्नप्राशन== - Feeding the kid Kheer after Breast-feeding cycle finishes!
8. ==चूड़ाकर्म== - Aasaan bhaasha mein Mundan bolte hai Haryanvi mein - the kid's head gets shaven at the first, third, fifth or seventh year of birth (only done once)
9. ==विद्यारंभ== - Basic Knowledge given at the household before he goes off to Gurukul. Alphabets, numbers, Stories like Ramayan and mahabharata etc.
10. ==कर्णवेध== - Done for both men and women. Men would also wear some jewelery in their ear tho
11. ==यज्ञोपवीत== - The child is adorned with the Sacred Thread - जनेऊ or यज्ञोपवीत or ब्रह्मसूत्र - This Sanskāra is also called as उपनयन संस्कार
12. ==वेदारंभ== - Start of the Vedic Education journey
13. ==केशांत== - marks transition from Brahmcharya to Grihasta
14. ==समावर्तन== - Done with the previous one - means that their journey in education has ended and they can marry now.
15. ==विवाह== - Marriage
16. ==अंत्येष्टि== - Furneral rites

The person who has performed all the 16 Sanskāras are known as Brahmins. According to BR Ambedkar's Book "Who were the Shudras" Chapter 12 - "The Theory in the Crucible" Page 259 point number 3 to 5, he said the following: ([link](https://www.marxists.org/archive/ambedkar/2015.143076.Who-Were-The-Shudras.pdf))
>"3. There was a time when the Aryan Society recognized only three varnas, namely, Brahmins, Kshatriyas and Vaishyas. Shudras were not considered a separate varna but a part of the Kshatriya varna"
>"4. There was a continuous feud between the Shudra Kings and the Brahmins in which the Brahmins were subjected to many tyrannies and indignities."
>"5. As a result of the hatred towards the Shudras due to their tyrannies and oppressions, the Brahmins refused to invest the Shudras with the Sacred Thread" 

{here, as established above, we know that Sacred Thread refers to यज्ञोपवीत or जनेऊ}

>"6. Owing to the loss of the Sacred Thread, the Shudras became Socially degraded, fell below the rank of Vaishyas and formed the fourth Varna"

The Caste System (Varna Vyavastha) Krishna talks about is based on Occupation, not the individual's birth.

Krishna explains the Caste System in Bhagwat Gita (श्रीमद्भागवत गीता)
>Translation:
>==Bhagwat Gita 18.41== "O Arjun! Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas and Shudras and their place in soceity is divided based on the clear distinction in their occupation and their स्वभाव (behaviour) 
>==Bhagwat Gita 18.42== "Brahmins, in their स्वभाव (behaviour) carry peace, self-control, spirituality, piousness, tolerance, honesty, the knowledge of the Vedas and unbreakable belief"
>==Bhagwat Gita 18.43== "Kshatriyas carry in their behaviour - Valour, Enthusiasm, Unbreakable Will, Well-endowed financial wealth, forgiveness, leadership while staying away from cowardice."
>==Bhagwat Gita 18.44== "Vaishyas carry in their behaviour Workaholism, love for farming, Cow-protection and trade. Shudras carry respect for elders, obedience and support for the other 3 as the backbone of the society"

### Mentions of Shudras in the Vedas 
Hindi: (वेदों में शूद्रों के विषय में कथन)

##### Yajurveda 30.5
> तपसे शुद्रम- यजुर्वेद 30/5 (Yajurveda 30.5)
> अर्थात- बहुत परिश्रमी ,कठिन कार्य करने वाला, साहसी और परम उद्योगों अर्थात तप को करने वाले आदि
> English Translation: Very Hardworking, doer of hard jobs, courageous, owners of best industries.  

##### Yajurveda 16.27
> नमो निशादेभ्य – यजुर्वेद 16/27 (Yajurveda 16.27)
> 
> अर्थात- शिल्प-कारीगरी विद्या से युक्त जो परिश्रमी जन (शूद्र/निषाद) हैं उनको नमस्कार अर्थात उनका सत्कार करें।
> Translation: Gifted with excellent craftsmanship skill, people with great zeal to do hardwork, greet them and treat them with respect.

##### Yajurveda 18.48
> रुचं शुद्रेषु- यजुर्वेद 18/48 (Yajurveda 18.48)
> 
> अर्थात- जैसे ईश्वर ब्राह्मण, क्षत्रिय, वैश्य और शूद्र से एक समान प्रीति करता हैं वैसे ही विद्वान लोग भी ब्राह्मण, क्षत्रिय, वैश्य और शूद्र से एक समान प्रीति करें।
> Translation: Just like Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas and Shudras are loved equally by Gods, similarly the wise must treat Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas and Shudras with equal love and respect.

Infact, keep in mind that the British had absolute control over information after banning Sanskrit Education in English Education Act brought by "Lord" MacCaulay in the English Education Act and he is also on record mentioning the same in a very famous 1835 speech.

It isn't like these sort of Systems didn't exist in other cultures and religions...

### Casteism in Buddhism (Lalitvistāra)
https://youtu.be/KjJ3vwaJLQc

In chapter 3 of Lalitvistara, a document of Mahāyāna (महायान) Buddhism (popular in India) has casteism's roots:
The name of the chapter itself is "Kul Shuddhi parivart" translating to "Chapter on Purification of the bloodline" in English.

Using the English translation from Dharmachakra Translation committee (most reputed ones - Buddhist equivalent of Gita press)
Translation to English are done by Tibetan Monks themselves... under the guidance of Choki Nimma Rimpoche.

According to the Chapter, The gods come to earth in form of humans (as Bodhisattva) to teach the Vedas (sounds eerily similar to the Sapt Rishis I know)
The interesting thing is they are never born outside of certain families... this is the point talked about here.

According to the chapter,
A Bodhisattva is never born in families of low clans like Candālās (चांडाल), Venukāras (वेनुकार who are flute makers), Rathkāras (रथकार Chariotmakers and Chariot-Saarthis/Driver), Pulkasas (despised offsprings of Nisāda makes and Shudra/Śūdra Females) 
The chapter states that a Bodhisattva is only born among the Brāhman/Brahmin (ब्राह्मण) and the Kshatriya (क्षत्रिय)

According to Buddha, Kshatriyas are superior to Brahmins🤣🤣

"Dalit" word sees origins in Buddhism instead of Hinduism.

==Buddhism is the one which infact started the trend of birth-based caste system!==


### Other Caste Systems around the world
==Chinese Caste System== 
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_occupations

The castes in India (as established were based on occupation and ranks) also saw many people use them as surnames but the Genealogy system used in England today is conveniently never called the "English Caste System"?

Why the British find it hard to introduce their students to colonial truths. British Empires are hardly taught of:

### Casteism in Islam
As much as Islamic Scholars want non-muslims to believe that Islam is free of casteism, the reality is quite different as there are castes based on perceived purity of DNA if you are Ashraf (for example)

### Delivering Checkmate using the Manusmriti itself
Finally for those who will try to quote Manusmriti, here is the checkmate...

> "If one is pure in thought, obedient to the elders, relies on the knowledge and is shikshit (educated) then they will attain a higher caste."
> *Manusmriti - अध्याय 9, श्लोक 335 (Chapter 9, Verse 335)*


> "A Shudra can become a Brahmin and a Brahmin can sink to the Shudra, the same can happen in case of Kshatriyas and Vaishyas."
> *Manusmriti अध्याय 10, श्लोक 65 (Chapter 10, Verse 65)*
