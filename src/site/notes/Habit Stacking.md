# What is *"Habit Stacking"* about?
The Book is about setting good habits and how one can make the process to do the same a tad bit easier.
A small summary of the book is provided as a bullet list below:
1. Identify key areas in life where you want to improve. If too busy, set priorities to improve one area initially with 5min habits and go one-by-one from there.
2. Focus on small wins: things that do not require much willpower. Start with just one maximum 30min stack of 6 habits (5min each). Add stacks as you go.
3. Do not try to do everything in the book which mentioned by the author. Your key areas may be different that theirs.
4. Anchor stack to a *trigger* event. Use checklists to maintain stack.
5. Focus on not dropping off for more than 1 day.
6. How to use productive Habit Stacks to do certain things in a flow.
7. How do Habit Stacks work and how to make the most of them
