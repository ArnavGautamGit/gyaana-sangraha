# Ramanujan Universe
It is a supercomputer established in JIIT-128 and the internship will be supervised by multiple professors such as Dr. Varun Srivastava
It is a type of [[High Performance Computing (HPC)\|High Performance Computing (HPC)]] facility where we run the same code on multiple processors. 
RU has extensive use in situations where we need High Performance Computing.

***==The Specifications==***:
110 Teraflops Speed
8 $\times$ A100 GPU Card Accelerator Compute Nodes 
Operating System used is Linux

The RU has a [[Evaluating Performance of Computer Systems#How do you calculate Speedup in Performance? \|Speedup]] of 24 compared to the regular PCs that we have at home.

## Process of Accessing the HPC
We have to fill a form and send it to the authorities and then go to the College physically and run your code after it has been approved. We have the problem of only 4 students being able to access the RU at once in the same time slot so I have to be quick. I also would need to mention the code I want to run in the form itself
