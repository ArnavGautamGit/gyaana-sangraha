# HAL Tejas (Mark-1A)
It is the upgraded version of the [[HAL Tejas\|HAL Tejas]].
In my perosnal opinion, this should have been the original Tejas and we should have begun working on [[HAL Tejas (Mk-2)\|HAL Tejas (Mk-2)]] a lot earlier so that HAL is free to begin manufacturing the [[AMCA\|AMCA]] earlier than before.
But it is just that... an opinion made from information available in open sources. The real situation may be different.

# The List of Upgrades
1. ***Line replaceable units*** are changed to decrease Turn Around Time and maintainance.
2. ***Software Defined Radios (SDRs)*** are improved and integrated from the start. They enable Tejas to not just see its own tarhet but the Tejas can see everything that the other friendlies can see as well 
3. ***RADAR*** of choice is the Isreali ALM-22 AESA. Although it is said that the Indigenous Uttam AESA is better but it is possible the version of Uttam is different than the regular.
4. ***Gallium NItride-based AESA Self-Protection jammer*** is incorporated which jams the RADARs of other aircrafts and incoming Fox-3 missiles. it is fixed at the outermost pylon of the aircraft.
5. ***ANGAD Electronic Warfare Suite*** has been added to the jet. Includes Digital RWR.
6. Primary Missiles for the platform are going to be the SRAM and the Astra Mk-1 [[Beyond Visual Range (BVR)\|Beyond Visual Range (BVR)]] Missile.
7. Internal cockpit changes like Multi-functional Displays, Symbology etc.

# Comparison with J-10C
[[Chengdu J-10C\|Chengdu J-10C]] is operated by the Chinese PLAAF and the Pakistani Air Force.
It is slightly unfair for it to be compared with the Tejas since the J-10C is bigger and a different category aircraft compared from the Tejas.
It has more endurance and range but it lacks any Electronic Warfare Capabilities since there have been no real photos of the J-10C with such equipment attached. All Indian combat aircraft platforms have Electronic Warfare Suites attached to them if not internally, than at least externally mounted ones. Most use the platforms Israeli Elta EL-822 but the Tejas Mk-1A uses the Angad EWS. It is said to be better than the Israeli one.

The J-10C is armed with the BL-15 BVR missile with a range of 140km and other missiles equivalent to any Russian missiles (which we also have) but it may have an advantage in BVR situations.
The Tejas being smaller, with a low [[RADAR Cross-Section (RCS)\|RADAR Cross-Section (RCS)]] and [[Electronic Warfare Suite (EWS)\|EWS]] capability, it is going to be hard to see & spot early - negating the J-10's advantage. The Tejas is said to have an RCS of 0.5$m^2$ making it almost on-par with the [[Sukhoi SU-57 Felon\|Sukhoi SU-57 Felon]] in terms of Stealth.
The J-10 uses barely any [[RADAR Absorbing Materials (RAM)\|RADAR Absorbing Materials (RAM)]] hence making its RCS closer to the 1$m^2$ and may as well be spotted earlier than the Tejas!

Both the jets are closely matched with a slight advantage to J-10C being bigger and having a higher fuel carrying capacity but the Tejas will give an intense fight. The fight can completely swing in Tejas's favour if there is 2 Tejas vs 1 J-10C which is very common since Tejas are supposed to be greater in number.
