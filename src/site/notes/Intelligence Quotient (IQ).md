# Intelligence Quotient (IQ)
> Mathematical Rating provided to a person (human) to find and rank their [[Cognitive Intelligence\|Intelligence]] among the other people.

It is popular in Psychology and allied Science Literature since it helps people identify how Intelligence Quotient can be used by people to find jobs that they like and love in combination with the Psychological [[Personality\|Personality]].

### History
It was first named the "g-factor" standing for General Intelligence.
It was named so by Charles Spearman when he was trying to find correlation with student grades across different subjects like checking is the students who scored well in Mathematics, would they score well on English too and vice-versa?

A [[Correlation Coefficient\|Correlation Coefficient]] of 0.64 was found in correlation and similar pattern of Positive Correlation was found when each subject taught in school was compared with each other subject i.e., the students who scored well on one subject were more likely to score well on the others since they were able to absorb and understand material quicker, have greater memory among other signs.

The correlations among English and Maths was 0.64 but correlation between Maths and Science cannot be 0.64 as well, it was a different correlation score across different subjects. So, spearman proposed the "s-factor" as a subject-specific factors which differed across subjects and could increase or decrease performance. He believed that general intelligence or "g" of an individual was fixed and "s" could be removed or cancelled out.

Effectively he treated "s" like [[Standard Deviation & Variance\|Standard Deviation]] and attempted to cancel it out using tests that measure MANY inversely-correlated or less-correlated subjects to cancel out inconsistencies as much as possible to acurate predict "g" or General Intelligence. 

Alfred Binet in France was one such person who in the early 1900s was able to devise such a test with another person he was working with - Th√©odore Simon, another frenchman.
He effectively created the "Binet-Simon Test". The test aimed at assigning them a mental age by tasking them this test along with students of their same age group. This mental age was divided by their actual age and then multiplied by 100 to get "Intelligence Quotient".

This same test was translated to English by Henry Goddard and taken to an American from Standford named (Lewis Terman) for standardisation in the USA and the shining beacon of Uncle Sam decided to rename it to "Stanford-Binet Test" after standardising it against an American population. Such a white thing to do to steal other's creations and renaming it after themselves - except it is a white man doing it to another white man this time.

Binet and Simon in France believed that with education, IQ can be increased and weaker students can be taught in different ways or given more time to study material. In the USA, the modified tests were used for adults to rank them by intelligence and genetically select the people who were more intelligent and prevent undesirable people from having kids to avoid spreading the low intelligence scores.

### Standardisation
The Standard IQ test, as it is seen today is done as the following:
All different tests were given to a large population size, raw scores were normalised to a mean was 100 with a [[Standard Deviation & Variance\|Standard Deviation]] of 15.

68% of people have an IQ between 85-115 (100 $\pm$ 15) 
while only 2% would score more than 130 or under 70. 

### Correlations
According to a study in 2005, there is 0.33 (or 33%) correlation between the IQ of an individual and their brain volume.

IQ is considered to have a correlation of 0.2 to 0.8 with USA-based curriculums. Many argue that SAT, ACT, GRE and similar tests are basically IQ tests with a correlation of 0.8 i.e., 1330 on a SAT corresponds to roughly an IQ of 130 but doesn't that make the tests trainable? A person with a great training and good understanding of question patterns can easily ace the IQ test.

### Problems
- Similarity in the types of questions asked.
	- In questions pertaining to series, the next term that is asked to be predicted is not even an Arithmetic or Geometric Progression, it is simple difference/multiple between terms increasing or decreasing
	- Questions like Raven's Progressive matrices have only 3 types: either the figures move laterally, or they move rotationally or there is a figure missing.
- The trainability of the tests.
	- Due to the reasons mentioned above, the tests can be trained on.
	- A person who has trained on a similar type of questions will score higher.
	- If a test can be trained/prepared for, are you testing natural general intelligence or are you testing the ability to recite and vomit whatever a person has crammed?
- IQ tests do not account for Cutural Changes, they are all white-European Centric.
	- Cultures that are oral in nature, would they even perceive things the same way when contrasted with cultures that are more focused on the written word?
- IQ is only one form of intelligence. many may be more intelligent or naturally "gifted" with Nature, Survival, Music, Emotions etc.
- The Flynn Effect in IQ is an effect discovered by researcher James Flynn where he checked and saw that every few decades, IQ scores had to be normalised and 100 years ago, average American IQ has increased by 30 leading to the fact that Americans of the past were "mentally retarded" by today's standard of 70 IQ which were 100 IQ back then. Nutrition and Education made that difference more than likely.
