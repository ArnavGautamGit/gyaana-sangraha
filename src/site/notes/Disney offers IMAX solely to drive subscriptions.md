# Disney offers IMAX solely to drive subscriptions
> [[IMAX Film Aspect Ratio\|IMAX Film Aspect Ratio]] is a format which is closer to the 16:9 screen size than the cinematic scope of [[Widescreen Film Aspect Ratio\|Widescreen Film Aspect Ratio]] formats.

Disney is reportedly enhancing older titles with IMAX ratio or using the IMAX cuts but providing them only on Disney+ Subscriptions instead of the physical editions (both [[Blu-Ray Discs\|Bluray]] and 4K UHD discs come in Widescreen Aspect Ratio only) 

Disney is using this tactic to drive subscriptions towards their platform's highest paid tier. The problem is that in many movies, the [[IMAX Film Aspect Ratio\|IMAX Film Aspect Ratio]] is retrofitted i.e., it was either not there in the original cut or the scenes were planned with Widescreen in mind. 

### Increased Negative Space makes IMAX look worse
This softens all the closeup shots by adding more [[Negative Space\|Negative Space]] in the shot meaning that in many places the widescreen ends up being MORE immersive since a higher percentage of the screen is dominated by the actors/characters (screenshot attached)

The difference in [[Negative Space\|Negative Space]] is also visible in shots where Ant-Man uses Pym Particles to increase his size to Giant-Man. He looks much bigger on the widescreen due to dominating the space there.

### Intentional Brightness Reduction
Disney is also reportedly reducing the brightness on the widescreen versions of movies indiscriminately (regardless of being from [[Blu-Ray Discs\|Blu-Ray Disc]] or Streaming) like Black Panther where the movie looks better in Widescreen despite both versions having [[Dolby Vision\|Dolby Vision]]. This extends to those shots in the IMAX version which were not shot with IMAX.

### Conclusion
If you want to buy the blurays for cheap (since the good movies are quite old now) you will have to deal with no IMAX while if you pay less on Disney+, this will be worse since they might put ads on their platform at any time & lock the IMAX versions behind a paywall once they get enough subscribers. It indeed holds true that [[Blu-Ray is better than Streaming\|Blu-Ray is better than Streaming]]
