# Social Proof
> Tendency of indiduals validating their behaviour & opinion against the popularity of the same in the general population. That is, said individuals feel that they are behaving correctly or saying the right thing if there are other people doing the same thing or validating the same opinion.

There is also the element of [[Confirmation Bias\|Confirmation Bias]] that the more people that validate the behaviour, the more reinforced it becomes in our head. These reinforced biases are even harder to break - often leadinf to an outburst due to an ego attached to them since they have been a part of our conscious for so long that we start associating this behaviour/opinion as a part of us and it being broken is like a part of our being being ripped from us.

Some people of rebellious nature may showcase Social Proof less in opinions & behaviour but no human is immune to it due to [[Evolutionary Biology\|Evolutionary Biology]] - the ones of our ancestors in the caveman age that did not run with the others when the others saw a large wild animal attack the group died and were deleted from the [[Genetic Gene Pool\|Genetic Gene Pool]]. We are the descendents of those that did survive, the ones who showcased the earliest forms of social proof: "If they ran, I should too". 

### Variants
