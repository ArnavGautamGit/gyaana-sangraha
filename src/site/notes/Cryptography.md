# Cryptography
Defined in my own words as:
> The art of hiding the data using to make the resulting cryptic text look unreadable by conventional means by anyone who does not have access to the original text.

Cryptography is performed by using [[Cryptographic Encryption Algorithms\|Cryptographic Encryption Algorithms]].

There are some terms we must keep in mind:
1. ***Encoding***: Process of translating entire words or phrases to other words or phrases to hide the real meaning of the message. Its opposite is decoding.
{ #1}

2. ***Enciphering***: Translating letters or symbols individually using a specific [[Cipher\|Cipher]] to hide the real meaning of the text or message. Nowadays, it is used interchangably with encoding. Its opposite is deciphering.
{ #2}

3. ***Encryption***: The process of encoding a message so that its meaning is not obvious. It is a group term that contains both encoding and enciphering.
{ #3}

4. ***Decryption***: (*Opposite of Encryption*) The process of transforming an encrypted text/message back to its original form. We can also say, we encipher/encode/encrypt the encrypted message INTO the original message.
{ #4}

5. ***Cryptosystem***: A system for encryption and decryption.
{ #5}

6. ***Plaintext***: Message in its original form.
{ #6}

7. ***Ciphertext***: Message in its *encrypted* form.
{ #7}

8. ***[[Key\|Key]]***: A value or group of values used to encrypt and decrypt the message. It is always fixed for a specific message or a specific kind of message.
{ #8}

9. ***Sender***: The entity (human or machine) which is sending the message.
{ #9}

10. ***Recipient***: The enitity (human or machine) which is receiving the message.
{ #10}

11. ***Transmission Medium***: The entity carrying the message from sender to receiver.
{ #11}

12. ***Interceptor/Intruder***: Term used for an entity trying to block, intercept, modify or fabricate the message (affecting its integrity) for any reason.
{ #12}
