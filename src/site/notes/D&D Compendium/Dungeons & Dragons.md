# Dungeons & Dragons
> A [[Table-Top Role-Playing Game\|Table-Top Role-Playing Game]], originally made in the 20th century but has received many updates over the years. The Latest one (which this notes uses) is the 2024 update to the game's 5th Edition. 

A D&D game is really set around the players - the players make their characters and the DM (Dungeon Master) is the one that really crafts the story to life - the individual stories of all the players and also the overall story of the world.

To play a D&D game, the best path is to follow the list below:
[[D&D Compendium/D&D Player's Handbook\|D&D Player's Handbook]]
[[D&D Compendium/D&D Dungeon Master's Guide\|D&D Dungeon Master's Guide]]
[[D&D Monster Manual\|D&D Monster Manual]]
[[D&D 5.5e Conversion Guide\|D&D 5.5e Conversion Guide]] (helps convert 2014 rules to 2024)

Expanded Rulebooks from 2014:
[[D&D Xanathar's Guide to Everything\|D&D Xanathar's Guide to Everything]] (not owned by me)
[[D&D Tasha's Cauldron of Everything\|D&D Tasha's Cauldron of Everything]] (not owned by me)

Pre-made Adventure Modules from 2014 that I own:
[[Lost Mines of Phandelver\|Lost Mines of Phandelver]]
[[Candlekeep Mysteries\|Candlekeep Mysteries]]
[[Dragon of Icespire Peak\|Dragon of Icespire Peak]]
[[Storm Kings Thunder\|Storm Kings Thunder]]
