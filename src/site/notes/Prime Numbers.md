# Prime Numbers
> A number or numbers that have no [[Factors\|Factors]] except 1 and the number itself, is known as a Prime Number. 
> In other words, numbers that are not divisble by any numbers other than 1 and the number itself.

For smaller numbers under 100 or under 50, testing for Prime Numbers is easy by using a variety of divisiblity tests to check if the number is divisible by 2, 3, 5, etc.
But for big Prime Numbers such as the ones used for the [[RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adelman)\|RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adelman)]] require [[Primality Testing\|Primality Testing]] to check if they are actually Prime or not.
