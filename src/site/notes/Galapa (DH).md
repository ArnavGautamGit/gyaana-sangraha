# Galapa (Daggerheart)
> A [[DH Species Ancestry\|DH Species Ancestry]] of anthromorphic turtles i.e., turtles that can walk on two of the legs & use the other two as hands with distinct, sharp fingers. 

Galapa's are said to decorate their shells by carving and shaping them (similar to how a soft skinned species like Humans would get tattoos) or they could reinforce their shells with Armour. Their arms tend to be very thick. Damaged shells can be repaired and in roughly 10 years a heavily damaged shell regrows.

On taking Galapa, you get the following Ancestry Features:
- ***Shell of Protection***: Add your [[Proficiency Level\|Proficiency Level]] to your [[Armour Score\|Armour Score]].
- ***Slow and Steady***: Once per short rest, you can gain advantage in all Attack Rolls of that battle using this feature.

Lifespan of an Average Galapa: 150 years (on my table they live 500 years - because turtles live wayy longer than 150).
