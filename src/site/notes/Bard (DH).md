> A [[DH Character Creation#Character Class\|Character Class]] of a charismatic Musician, Wordmith or Motivator in the famous [[Table-Top Role-Playing Game\|Table-Top Role-Playing Game]] named [[Daggerheart\|Daggerheart]].
> (See [[DH Character Creation#Character Class\|DH Character Creation#Character Class]] to get a general overview of classes)

Bards (across TTRPGs) are famous for being scandalous and having an eloquent talent such as singing, dancing, poetry and such...
But they also motivate their teammates and other abilities.

### Domains
Domains of a Class decide what Domain Cards (and abilities) one gets to pick up.
The Bard's domains are: [[Grace\|Grace]] and [[Codex\|Codex]].

### Base Scores
Base [[Evasion Score\|Evasion Score]]: 9
Major Damage Threshold: 6
Severe Damage Threshold: 12

### Class Items
Each Class also has a specific item they can choose to have. They must have one of two.
For a Bard, chose between a Romance Novel or a Letter never opened.

### Bard's Hope
Bard's Hope is a special ability of the Bard class that utilizes.
The player can spend 3 [[Hope Token\|Hope Token]] to intervene and negate the consequences of any [[Presence\|Presence]] Roll where a teammate close to them fails the roll or succeeds with Fear Dice (and hence deny the GM their [[Fear Token\|Fear Token]]).

### Class Feature - Rally
Once per session, before entering a dangerous situation, you can chose to Rally your teammates and give your allies an extra d6 dice that they can roll. 
The players can choose to roll this "Rally Dice" whose result can be added to an action roll, reaction roll, damage roll or clear the number of [[Stress Point\|Stress Points]] equal to the value rolled on the dice. 
Unused Rally Dice are cleared after the session and the Rally Dice is upgraded to a 1d8 after Level 5.

### Class Foundations (Subclasses)
Both of the foundations use [[Presence\|Presence]] as the Spellcasting trait.
The Bard has the following Subclass Options:
- ***==Wordsmith==*** allows players to roleplay a poetic bard who uses captivating words and inspiring wordplay to aid any comrades.
	- ***Foundation Features***
		- ***Heart of a Poet***: When speaking to a person you're trying to impress, persuade, or offend, you can spend Hope and add 1d4 to the action roll against them.
		- ***Rousing Speech***: Once per long rest, you can use an action to give a heartfelt, inspiring speech. All allies who can hear you clear two Stress.
	- ***Specialisation Features***
		- Once per session you can use your skills as a linguist to do ONE of the following:
			- Allow an ally to find a mundane object or tool they need.
			- Help an Ally without spending Hope.
			- Give them an additional downtime move during a rest.
	- ***Mastery Feature***
		- The Rally Dice increased to 1d10.
		- In addition, whenevr you help an ally, if you choose to give them advantage by reciting their moment as if writing a tale of heroism in a memoir, you give your ally a 1d10 advantage dice instead of 1d6. 
- ***==Troubadour==*** allows players to rolepay the musical bard who inspires any comrades using the power of songs and music. You have to choose an instrument that you play throughout this campaign.
