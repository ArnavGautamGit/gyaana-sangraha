# Virualisation
> Technology that allows multiple operating systems to be run in the same machine in their own virtual space which is reserved for that operating system on the drive & not shared among others.

An application of this technology created the concept of a [[Virtual Machine\|Virtual Machine]] which runs like a segregated machine in its own small portion of their resources - it cannot take resources that are not assigned to it & hence cannot take much heavier loads.

It is driven by a software that separates the hardware from the existing [[Operating System\|Operating System]] so that multiple processes can be run side by side on it.
