# Racism Against Indians in South Korea
> Practice of [[Racism Against Indians\|Racism Against Indians]] practices by South Koreans.
> (removed linked note "Racism Against Indians" due to it being unfinished).

A commonplace nowadays when there are Indians who absolutely love everything that is Korean and they go crazy for Korean snacks & other amenities (enough so that its is now even sold by Blinkit and bought by spineless chhapris who do not have taste). 

A lot of racist instances go unnoticed or they are brushed aside since "there are racists everywhere" and "only a few people are racists" etc.
The thing is there are much bigger instances of racism that no one in South Korea even protested against (rather made the series including those racist comments very popular)!

### ***Example 1***: Redice Studios & Solo Levelling Manhwa
Redice Studios - the biggest name in Manhwa business and the creators of the famous Manhwa "Solo Levelling" (which also became a show later) released a new manhwa named "Regressing with the King’s Power". If you are going to read Chapter 27 of that Manhwa as an Indian you will find it quite disturbing.

The villain of the story is of Indian Origin who is named "Narandra Neru", there is no need to explain that the name is derived from two of India's Longest Serving Prime Ministers i.e., the serving PM (Narendra Modi) and the first-ever PM of India (Jawaharlal Nehru). Where the first name is taken from the former while the last name is taken from the latter.

Being portrayed as a villian is fine but this character named after Indian Prime Ministers ***runs a Terrorist Organisation which conducts terror attacks like [[9-11 Terrorist Attack\|9/11]]*** (which didn't involve Indians at all by the way).

The important thing to note is that this character is greeting with a Namaste, which is classically a greeting of Indian & Hindu Origin. So the defense that there was a particular confusion regarding Afghans & Indians or Pakistanis & Indians flies right out of the window.

Before the Apologists fly in, we do not equate any particular race of people with Osama Bin Laden just because they lived closer to each other. Also the apologists and the Korea fangirls will try the argument that "Indians are racist too"... Are you implying it is okay to be racist to a group of people where a small minority is racist? That in itself is the definition of racism because I cannot (and should not) justify racism against the black people due to racist comments from a few.

This is ***NOT the first time Redice Studios have done something like this***. It is a regular occurance and they are habitual repeat offenders of this. Redice themselves have done this before, in one of the chapters of their manhwa named "Solo-Max Level Newbie", they had this weird segment involving two Indian Characters named "Chandra" and "Arun". The main character of the Manhwa comic made them run semi-naked in Seoul, and its news was shown on TV that those two characters got arrested.

### ***Example 2***: Road Signs of "Indians not allowed" all around Seuol
I don't even care to spell the city's name correctly at this point where Indians are treated with similar sign boards like the 20th Century British Colonial times despite Korea itself having a brutal history of colonisation. This is the equivalent of Apartheid where certain locations were off-limits for natives just because their skin looked different to the whites.

These signs were exposed in videos by YouTubers like [Nikita Thakur](https://youtu.be/fgHN5ErCAdk?feature=shared), [Nomadic Indian](https://youtu.be/XQoL0_L0ge4?feature=shared) and [Bibim Korea 비빔코리아](https://youtube.com/shorts/9m9sE-9BOk0?feature=shared). Clicking on each link will redirect you to respective videos. Note that there are MANY MANY MORE such videos where you can see the sources.

Don't even try to whitewash this as something like "protecting your culture against foreigners" since South Korea's neighbouring country (Japan) doesn't single out Indians specifically by nationality & race like this. They dis-allow all non-Japanese in certain parts yes, but that is a blanket rule which is not specific to individual races/nationalities like this to make them feel like they are specifically targeted. They definitely do not showcase Indians as a group of Terrorists committing attacks like [[9-11 Terrorist Attack\|9/11]].

### Korean Carmakers making Korean-only restaurants in INDIA!
This is one that governments should crack down on even if it means sending these koreans packing out of here & handing over their factories to Suzuki free of charge. These Korean car manufacturers like Hyundai and KIA have made some Korean food outlets near their factories and manufacturing plants where Indians are not allowed to eat.

These guys cannot restrict entry to anyone based on Article 15 of the [[Constitution of India\|Constitution of India]] and hence must open their outlets to all or shut them down for good. Even if it means we lose 2 car manufacturers who majorly sell a total of 4 car models namely Seltos, Creta, Verna and i20 NSXYZ whatever. All these models are infamous for being driven by classless people anyway.

We should also make an example out of Samsung & hand their facotry over to Apple for free or minimal fee to manufacture more iPhones in India than before. Racism must not be tolerated when our people and land is the reason they get to thicken their profit margins.

### Innocent Indian Tourists arrested on arrival
Videos like [this one in Hindi](https://youtu.be/2KNYUjk3tAI?si=dE8K-rnE2-NXG7IQ) showcase how deeply entrenched is the racism in South Korea. Granted when this incident occured (Dec 2025) people of Pakistani and Bangladeshi origin were completely banned from landing on Jeju Island, Indians were not banned. Indian couples with Indian Passports should not be detained for coming to Jeju when entry of Indians is NOT banned as of Feb 2026...

Sachin Awasthi (in that linked video) arrived via Seoul and hence had to go through immigration instead of arriving directly at Jeju but detaining him and not allowing him to leave and giving a fake contact of the Indian Embassy means that there was presumption of crime (opposite to the presumtion of innocence under International Law) which means this is a warcrime committed at the time of peace.
