# Warrior (DH)
> A [[DH Character Creation#Character Class\|Character Class]] of strong soldiers who may be a part of organised military or mercenary or a lone wolf. Known for great [[Strength\|Strength]] and Skill. More Agile than [[Guardian (DH)\|Guardians]] but unlike Guardians, cannot protect others from harm

The only equivalent in [[Dungeons & Dragons\|D&D]] is the [[Fighter (D&D)\|Fighter (D&D)]].

### Domains
Domains of a class decide the Domain Cards (and abilities) one gets to pick up.
Each Class has 2 fixed Domains.
The Warrior's Domains are: [[Blade\|Blade]] and [[Bone\|Bone]].

### Base Scores
Base [[Evasion Score\|Evasion Score]]: 10
Major Damage Thresholds: 7
Severe Damage Thresholds: 14

### Class Items
Each Class has a specific item they choose which will be a plot point in the story. They
must choose one of the options.
For a Warrior, choose EITHER *"Drawing of a Lover"* OR *"Sharpening Stone"*

### Warrior's Hope - Special Ability
Spend 3x [[Hope Token\|Hope Token]] to reroll any number of your damage dice on an attack.

### Class Features
***Battle Strategist*** allows the player to describe how they outmaneuver the target after they get a successful attack roll. They mark a [[Stress Point\|Stress Point]] to deal a [[Stress Point\|Stress Point]] on the target.

***Attack of Opportunity*** make a reactionary parry against an oncoming attack & choose one of the following if the Agility Roll is successful (choose two of the following if the roll is a Critical Success):
- Deal Weapon Damage
- Keep the enemy from moving
- Move with your enemy

***Combat Training*** allows the Warrior to ignore burden & add their level to the result of an attack roll on attacks made with a weapon which deals Physical Damage.

### Class Foundations (Subclasses)
There are two subclasses which (in my opinion) are not that different mechanically & the choice depends on playstyle.

- ***==Call of the Slayer==*** allows the player to strike down enemies with damage & power.
	- ***Foundation Feature***
		- On a roll with Hope, you gain a d6 Slayer dice. You can store a number of Slayer dice equal to your Proficiency. When you make an attack roll or damage roll, you can spend any number of these Slayer dice, rolling them and adding their value to your total. At the end of a session, clear any remaining Slayer dice on this card and gain that many [[Hope Token\|Hope Token]] for the next session.
	- ***Specialisation Feature***
		- You can wield multiple weapons with dangerous ease. When you make a successful Attack Roll, you can spend a [[Hope Token\|Hope Token]] to add one damage die from your secondary weapon to the damage. In addition, once per long rest, when you roll your Slayer dice, you can reroll any 1s once, taking the new result.
	- ***Mastery Feature***
		- **Martial Preparation**: You’ve become an inspirational warrior to all who travel with you. You gain access to the Martial Preparation downtime move. To use this during a rest, describe how you instruct and train with your party, then give yourself and each ally a Slayer die, which is a d6. Allies can spend your Slayer die to enhance their own weapon Attack or Damage rolls.
- ***==Call of the Brave==*** allows the player to play as a brave Warrior who does not shy from Battle (play [[Guardian (DH)\|Guardian (DH)]] at this point, in my opinion)
	- ***Foundation Feature***
		- When you fail a roll with Fear, you gain a Hope.
		- Once per long rest, before you attempt something incredibly dangerous or face off against a foe who clearly outmatches you, describe what ritual you perform or preparation you make, then clear 2x [[Stress Point\|Stress Point]] and gain 2x [[Hope Token\|Hope Token]].
	- ***Specialisation Feature***
		- You are vigilant in the face of mounting danger.
		- While you have $\leq$ 2 [[Hit Point Slots\|Hit Point Slots]] unmarked, your Hope die becomes a d20.
	- ***Mastery Feature***
		- Your unbending courage is a rallying point for your allies. You can initiate a Tag Team Roll one extra time per session.
		- Additionally, when an ally initiates a Tag Team Roll with you, they only need to spend 2x [[Hope Token\|Hope Token]] to do so.
