# Docker
> A [[Cloud Computing\|Cloud Computing]] service that allows users to replicate their coding project's files and also the project dependencies & environment as a singular bundled unit (called a Container) that can be shared with peers or deploy as a finished project.

It is used to eliminate any changes or discrepancies between the development environment and the user environment. It helps in seamless deployment.

### Container
Containers are lightweight (can be easily shared, updated, made or destroyed).
Containers are shared and replicated using a Docker Image 

### Image
The file which contains the instructions of regenerating the container i.e., the container can be shared by using the image as the shared file. It is similar to the concept of how a [[Object Oriented Programming#Classes\|Class]] is used to define a template to create an [[Object Oriented Programming#Objects\|Object]].

### DockerHub
A website like GitHub which allows users to upload & share their Docker Images to share and update our Container.

### Differences with AWS
Where [[Amazon Web Services (AWS)\|Amazon Web Services (AWS)]] allow to provide infrastructure (like Cloud Databases), Docker allows you to package & deploy your application in a standard way.
