# Make time for yourself and YOUR tasks
Small things you can give up:
1. Skip half an hour of TV
2. Bring your own lunch & eat at your desk, complete a stack in lunch break

Once you do that, wake up earlier
1. Go to bed 30 minutes earlier
2. 30 min per day = 210 min per week = more Energy!

If you cannot find time due to "life happens" type of stuff then:
1. Wake up before everyone else
2. Understand bad triggers which makes you procrastinate
3. Plan day with if-else statements.
4. Avoid all tech for 15 minutes before the routine
5. Promise to treat yourself to a reward later that day/week.
6. Let everyone know (schedule the time in work calendar).

Take ACTION:
1. Write down 25 things you wanna do in the near future.
2. Now circle any 5.
3. Anything you circled, figure out an action plan for those 5 and start working on them.
4. After that start working on the action plan.
5. Anything you did not circle became "avoid at all costs" list. DO NOT WORK ON ANY OF THEM UNTIL THESE 5 ARE DONE!
