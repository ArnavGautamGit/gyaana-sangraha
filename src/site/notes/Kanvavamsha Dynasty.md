# Kanvavamsha (Kanva) Dynasty
> Minor empire in the Magadha region in the Gangetic Plains centred at Pataliputra (Patna) which could never expand much beyond contemporary Bihar, Bengal & Bangladesh of today. 

It was mentioned to have ruled from Pataliputra in the [[Purāṇa\|Purāṇa]] sources but majority coins were found near Vidisha (or Besnagar) which is where the later [[Shunga Dynasty\|Shunga Dynasty]] rulers also ruled from (as the capital).

### Formation
Kanva Empire (also called Kanvavamsha Dynasty) replaced the [[Shunga Dynasty\|Shunga Dynasty]] in poetically the same manner the Shungas replaced [[Mauryan Empire\|Mauryan Empire]] - by assassination. The following exerpt is from the note on Shunga dynasty:

[[Devabhuti Shunga\|Devabhuti Shunga]] was overtly interested in women and was overall a good-for-nothing lazy dude who is clearly not fit to be the Emperor. He was assassinated by his minister collaborating with one of his female servants (disguised as the empress) while Devabhuti was drunk. This is when his minister [[Vasudeva Kanva\|Vasudeva Kanva]] made the killing move and established the [[Kanvavamsha Dynasty\|Kanvavamsha Dynasty]]. This entire event is documented by medieval era poet [[Banabhatta\|Banabhatta]] in his autobiography of [[Harshavardhan\|Harshavardhan]] named as "[[Harshacharita\|Harshacharita]]". Harsha was from the [[Pushyabhuti Dynasty\|Pushyabhuti Dynasty]].

# Footnotes
Only one of the mid-sized empires to have absolutely ZERO cultural contribution to Bihar & to India. If proven wrong, I will add it here.
