# Monero (XMR)
> Privacy-Focused [[Cryptocurrency\|Cryptocurrency]] that keeps the transaction IDs of both parties and the transaction amount private & untrackable similar to how individual Cash Coins/Notes despite being numbered cannot be tracked to the exact trail of people a particular note or coin went through.

It is important to note that this untracability is why Cash cannot be used on transactions larger than a set sum without attracting government eyes or the transaction as a whole being considered against the "guidelines".

### How does Monero work?
Most Cryptocurrencies like [[Bitcoin (BTC)\|Bitcoin (BTC)]], [[Ethereum (ETH)\|Ethereum (ETH)]] and others like them are hosted on a public [[Blockchain\|Blockchain]] where all transactions along with sender, receiver and transaction amount is logged & hence movement can be studied. 

Monero (unlike puclic crypto) is NOT searchable and DOES NOT have a permanent record of transaction due to it not having a public ledger that lists all transactions as they are... Monero uses [[Ring Signatures\|Ring Signatures]] which involve sending a group of sender IDs, receiver IDs and transaction amounts (e.g. random 10 values of each of them) while the real values could be any one of them at random.

Every time one receives a payment via Monero, there is a new one-time payment address that is created to replace the last one used, these are called Stealth Addresses.

### Why is it attracting bans & removals
Imagine if this kind of privacy comes in the hands of the people in digital transactions. For the general public it is amazing privacy but in the wrong hands of the rich it is a tool of money laundering. This is why Monero is also attracting bans and removals from Centralised Crypto Exchanges but Monero can be directly bought in [[Decentralised Crypto Exchange\|Decentralised Crypto Exchange]].

### How to get Monero?
Turn on your [[Virtual Private Network (VPN)\|VPN]] and fire up [[The Onion Router (TOR)\|TOR]] broswer to buy BTC and then swap for XMR on Retoswap or some other [[Decentralised Crypto Exchange\|Decentralised Crypto Exchange]] before transferring Monero to a [[Non-Custodian Wallet\|NC Wallet]] like Cake Wallet.
