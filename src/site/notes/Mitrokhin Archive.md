# Mitrokhin Archive
> The Archive was named after the primary archiver - Vasili Nikitich Mitrokhin of the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR)\|Soviet Union]] who escaped to London in 1991.

The Archive was published in 2 parts with the second one publishing after the passing of Vasili Mitrokhin & his name is not there as the co-author on the covers of the second book (or at least the current edition of the second book).

### Story behind the Archive
> "Posted since 1956 in the archives department of the First Chief Directorate, Mitrokhin had surreptitiously copied out the contents of the records in his own handwriting, even taking the papers home. Every Night, he would laboriously type out the records and store them in an empty milk cartons which he hid under the floor. There were 25,000 pages that the SUS would help retrieve from Moscow.
> 
> Over time, the documents were translated, placed in order and analysed, and finally, Operation GUNNER of the SIS yielded two books: *'The Sword and the Shield: The Mitrokhin Archive and the Secret History of the KGB'* (1999) and *'The World Was Going Our Way: The KGB and the Battle for the Third World'* (2005). The first book appeared 7 years after Mitrokhin's escape, it took another six years for the second to be published a year after the Russian died in 2004"

### Popular Criticisms of the Archive
It requires immense effort to be able to type out 25,000 pages of unordered, sometimes incomplete and often unconnected documents without knowing what to do with them. Especially when we do not know whether that process of manually copying the files was done without errors.
It is fair to say that Vasili Mitrokhin would be willing to sell the documents to Intelligence agencies for money or citizenship or both. But, Russia is not THAT far behind Europe in development & why would a 70 year old want to earn beyond his pension in post-retirement age when his expenses aren't even lavish?

It is obvious that in many places, meaning would be lost in translation. If so, how much of meaning was lost? What part is true and what part isn't.

Why was Christopher Andrew asked to author the books instead of a Bibliographer, Historian or Archivist? The Mitrokhin Archive is bigger than my Obsidian Vault and especially so when you see beyond the Academic Notes. I am confused why such an archive was handed over to someone who was not that experienced handling thousands of pages.

Not a single Conservative Party member in the UK was named. Only Liberal Paty members were named. Was the Soviet Union working only through the Liberal Party? What about people who switched parties?
