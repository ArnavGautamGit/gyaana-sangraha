# Mobile Phone Privacy
> Maintaining [[Personal Online Privacy\|Personal Online Privacy]] on your Mobile Phone so that you can rest assured to not be able to be tracked much.

I will assume you have taken all steps discussed in the [[Personal Online Privacy\|Personal Online Privacy]] note along with the extra tips written at the bottom. I would also recommend following all of them.

> [!tip] TIP: All the Hardware applies to Laptops too!
> All of the hardware-level protections like a privacy screen and a webcam cover also apply to Laptops since they also have similar accesories available for them! Hurray!

### Privacy Screen Protector
This is particularly useful if you have nosy parents or if you frequenctly take Mass Transit.
Some of them come in the form of a full front & back cover but I feel I can get a much better option. Get one of those which offer it as a tempered glass which is tinted or polarised or both. It allows you to use specific back cover discussed ahead.

### Back Cover with Camera Protector
Those ones that have a slider which covers the area over the back camera so that the camea lenses can be protected has a dual use in stopping background apps from using your phone's back camera to spy on you since all they would see is a black screen.

### Front Camera (Webcam) Cover
There are many packs-of-3 or packs-of-6 webcam covers that are sold on as cheap as 1 USD or 99 INR on many online retailers as soon as you type "webcam blocker" or "webcam cover" in their search bar you will see 100s of such products.

### Mic Blocker or Faraday Cage Bag
If your phone has a 3.5 mm headphone jack in it, it is a great idea to instead of buying those 3.5 mm mic blockers specifically, it is easier to get those 3.5mm to 6.5mm adapters and then just connect the empty adapter to the 3.5 mm jack on your phone. Although, I have not tested it, the empty adapter trick should theoretically work... 
3.5mm mic blockers are at least more full proof & reassuring. 

If you want something more substantial in case your phone uses Type C with no headphone jack then you can opt for Faraday Bags that are obviously the best bet but you would not be able to use the screen either.

### Rewire your Operating System for Privacy
[[Android OS\|Android OS]] is a dumpsterfire of surveillance. Apple at least makes basic things such as encrypting your cloud backups via Advanced Data Protection into a toggle switch. Similarly Lockdown Mode (that can protect you against Nation-State actors) is also a toggle.

Best is to use a Google Pixel to load a custom ROM like [[Graphene OS\|Graphene OS]] on it. Why Graphene? Because as we learnt in [[Personal Online Privacy#First Step to Privacy - Compartmentalisation\|Compartmentalisation as the First Step to Online Privacy]] we saw that your life should be segregated. Now what if the OS segregated your apps into groups of profiles? A profile for google apps completely disconnected from your profile on pseudonymous social media and such.

[[Graphene OS\|Graphene OS]] can be coupled with an iPhone running Apple's latest [[iOS\|iOS]] version so that critical apps like the ones used for banking can work seamlessly (since not all apps work perfectly with Graphene OS) while stock/commercial [[Android OS\|Android OS]] should not even be on your list at all.

Read specific notes for [[Privacy on iPhone\|Privacy on iPhone]] and [[Privacy on Android\|Privacy on Android]] (coming soon) but I must say that Apple has trivialised privacy in the way that many privacy features are basically a toggle & easy to use.

### Reboot your phone more often
PIN is stored on RAM after first unlock to make unlocks faster. Reboots wipe the RAM memory and the data inside (specifically clicking "shut down" instead of "restart").

### Airplane Mode & Location Tracking
Blocks SIM service & SIM-based location tracking.
One that uses OpenStreetMap API like OsmAnd and other [[Free & Open Source Software (FOSS)\|FOSS]] navigation apps.
Mobile Apps like Google Maps share all your location history with their servers. You would probably not like to see all that stuff they have on you because it is truly scary how much they know and list for you to see (only if you know where to look).

Similarly, do not leave your Wi-Fi on if you are not using it currently. Turn it off if you are not using WiFi. Turn on Airplane Mode if you don't want to receive calls. Stop being so easy to reach that others can dustract you from your goals because they want you to do XYZ things. Do warn the closest friends and family around you that you would be doing things like this and take things slowly to avoid inducing panic in their minds that something may have happened to you because everytime they call you, you are on airplane mode.

### Restrict phones to communication
Remember in [[Personal Online Privacy\|Personal Online Privacy]] we talked about compartmentalisation as the first step? It also is the same if you keep your phone for anything other than what it was originally intended for... 

Use Cash or Card for most payments and then you can always rely on things such as an actual separate GPS device instead of having the Google Maps app interconnect with the same account that you use for YouTube and Google Pay!

I only use my smartphone for communication, UPI payments, tracking ToDo Lists and taking some photos. I very rarely use it for alarms or anything else as I am actively leaving social media by deleting my accounts and all associated data. I am doing it for X and Facebook accounts currently and have already wiped my Google Accounts completely clean (and set them to auto-delete data).

For entertainment I use many other devices like my PlayStation for gaming & playing BluRays while I use my other entertainment needs like streaming services are on devices that connect to my TV or my TV itself.
