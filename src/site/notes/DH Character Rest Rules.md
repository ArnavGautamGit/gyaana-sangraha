# DH Character Rest Rules
> Just like other games, Characters in [[Daggerheart\|Daggerheart]] are also free to take Long Rests and Short Rests given that the [[Game Master (GM)\|GM]] agrees to this.

Character Rests in [[Daggerheart\|Daggerheart]] are also governed by certain rules.
The Rules are as follows:
1. Characters cannot take rest while in combat.
2. Characters have to make a Downtime Move when resting.
3. Characters can only make TWO Downtime Moves unless an ability or feature allows you to make two.
4. Players have to describe each of their downtime moves.

### Downtime
Downtime is defined as the time while the characters are resting. Regardless of whether the rest is a Short Rest or a Long Rest, the moves the players can make are the same, only their affect changes.

The List of Downtime Player Moves are:
1. ***Tend to Wounds***: Patch up the wounds of your own or the wounds of an ally. In case of short rest, clear 1d4 [[Hit Point Slots\|Hit Point Slots]] while in case of a Long Rest, you can clear all marked HP Slots.
2. ***Clear Stress***: Either blow off steam or pull yourself together. In case of short rest, clear 1d4 [[Stress Point\|Stress Points]] while in case of Long Rest, you can clear all marked Stress Points.
3. ***Repair Armour***: Either repair your own armour or help an ally repair theirs. Replenish 1d4 [[Armour Slots\|Armour Slots]] on Short Rests and replenish ALL marked Armour Slots on a Long Rest.
4. ***Prepare***: You prepare for the oncoming path ahead and gain 1x [[Hope Token\|Hope Token]]. If you plan with one or more allies, each of you gains 2x [[Hope Token\|Hope Token]].

The GM can also make Downtime Moves.
The [[Game Master (GM)\|Game Master (GM)]] is entitled to advance a relevant long-term countdown (if any).
- In case of a Short Rest taken by the players, the GM gains [[Fear Token\|Fear Token]] equal to the result of a 1d4 dice roll. 
- In case of a Long Rest taken by the players, the GM gains [[Fear Token\|Fear Token]] equal to the result of 1d4 dice roll + Total Number of Players.
