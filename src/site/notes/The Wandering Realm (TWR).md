# The Wandering Realms D&D Server
The first Discord D&D server that introduced me to D&D in the first place.
I left it in 2022 because at the time it felt to busy - although the clicking of the "leave server" button was accidental... maybe... i don't remember properly.
I remember that the server was so busy I was unable to run my own campaign.

The campaigns are set around the wider setting of Sword Coast in The Forgotten Realms making this a [[Westmarches\|Westmarches]] server.

For the Map, Refer to [[Forgotten Realms Map.jpg|The Map of the Forgotten Realms]] by clicking on the purple text.
The Actual RP happens around The Sword Coast - which is a small part of the entire map.

Refer to [[Avrae Commands Sheet\|Avrae Commands Sheet]] to see Commands that one needs in the game when playing in D&D.

For the Server Lore, Refer to [[Lore of The Wandering Realm\|Lore of The Wandering Realm]]
For the Setting Lore, Refer to the wiki or something.

My characters:
[[Fenrir\|Fenrir]]
