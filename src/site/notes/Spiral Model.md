# Spiral Model
> An [[Evolutionary Software Models\|Evolutionary Software Model]] developed for Software Solutions which require an extensive list or many different layers of features to be added.

It is a hybrid of two models namely: [[Prototyping Model\|Prototyping Model]] and [[Waterfall Model\|Waterfall Model]]
While it uses principles of Prototyping where small prototype is first developed & features are added, Spiral Model aims to streamline the process and being in the strengths of Waterfall - namely the immense amount of documentation that Waterfall model excells in. 

This documentation is especially useful in case one of the developers resign or get allocated a different role in the company & there is a new joinee taking their place.

### Weaknesses
1. Difficult to convice the users & stakeholders that the Spiral is controllable.
2. If a major risk or fault is left in the cycle unmanaged, it can snowball into a massive error and grind the entire Spiral to halt.
