# Model Trains
> Miniature or Model versions of Real-Life Trains carrying Passengers or Freight.

Model Trains are sized by Ratio to Real-Life Trains. Depending upon HOW smaller a model train is to its real-life counterpart, it is given a [[Model Train Scale\|Model Train Scale]].
Just like IRL Trains, These trains have Fixed-[[Gauge (Railroad)\|Gauge]] Tracks that they run on.

Just like IRL Trains, these trains can also have [[Standard Gauge\|Standard Gauge]], [[Narrow Gauge\|Narrow Gauge]] and [[Broad Gauge\|Broad Gauge]] in the sense that an S-scale train can run on Standard Gauge of S-gauge while some models may be made to run on narrower HO-gauge or on broader O-gauge tracks if they are Narrow or Broad Gauge variants respectively.
