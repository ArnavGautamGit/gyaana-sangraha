# What is the book about?
> A book that teaches the reader a path of taking clear decisions based solely on the factual reality & free from any biases whether inherent or artificially planted in our brain. 

The book was originally written in German and translated to English by Nicky Griffin. I am reading the English Variant. It is an important book for taking clear decisions in life - especially in our Youth - since choices that are made here shape the direction of our lives - clarity of decisions would mean we are actually working towards a goal and making progress instead of being left course-correcting our entire Youth.

### Some Criticism
The Book suffers from a similar problem as another book - "[[Ikigai - The Japanese Secret to a Long and Happy Life\|Ikigai - The Japanese Secret to a Long and Happy Life]]" since it is another case of similarly having an unintentionally misleading title. Coincidentally both books mention [[Nassim Nicholas Taleb\|Nassim Nicholas Taleb]].

"The Art of Thinking Clearly" does not really talk about how to think clearly, each chapter is about a bias or fallacy that can cloud a decision and the chapter ends with the proposed solution on how to avoid the bias from clouding your judgement. The problem is that the book leaves the onus on the reader to maintain a massive checklist of biases and fallacies that we have to go through when taking a decision - the larger the inportance of said decision - the more thorough one has to be. The book does not explain any art of simplifying this process of thinking clearly (as it seems to promise in the title) rather is actually a "Compendium of Biases".
