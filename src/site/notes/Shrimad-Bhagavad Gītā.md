# What is the Scripture about?
> Bhagavad Gīta also called as "Shrimad-Bhagavad Gita" is one of the Hindu Scriptures which detail the conversation between [[Arjuna\|Arjuna]] and [[Lord Krishna\|Lord Krishna]] during the War of Kurukshetra in [[Mahābhārata\|Mahābhārata]].

Gīta (गीत) refers to a song but if it is said that a particular song is given by someone, rules of Sanskrit change it to Gītā (गीता) meaning "song of".
Bhagavad means divine. 
Hence it can be translated to *"The Song of the Divine"*.

It is sometimes referred to as a summary of the [[Mahābhārata\|Mahābhārata]] - since it summarises the war and its reasons as well throughout its length. It contains one of the most profound quotes that the Indic Hindu Philosophy has ever given. Although some facts are not stated as-is from the [[Mahābhārata\|Mahābhārata]] due to poetic constraints.
