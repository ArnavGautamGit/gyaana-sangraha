# Fixed Capital
> A type of [[Capital\|Capital]] which comprises of [[Asset\|Assets]] and Money used in setting up a business by acquiring [[Land\|Land]], building offices or factories on top of said land and getting anything else required to start production.

Without Fixed Capital, one can never acquire Assets and Raw Materials required to start a business and hence it is considered the most important aspect of starting a business. There are two ways of getting this capital. Either [[Paid-Up Capital\|Paid-Up Capital]] or [[Borrowed Capital\|Borrowed Capital]].

Sometimes, Founders may use a collateral (like Gold or Land that they own) to get a loan from a bank to finance their business given that the said collateral is first transferred to the company's name as long as the company is a separate entity from the founders just like the [[Limited Liability Proprietorship (LLP)\|Limited Liability Proprietorship (LLP)]].
