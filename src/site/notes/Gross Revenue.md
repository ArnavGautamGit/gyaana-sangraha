# Gross Revenue
> Also called as Invoice Value, it is the total revenue earned by the business after selling any number of products/service. It is important to note that [[Indirect Tax\|Indirect Tax]] is yet to be paid to the government.

In the easiest of terms, Gross Revenue is the [[Maximum Retail Price (MRP)\|Maximum Retail Price (MRP)]] of one product (inclusive of taxes) multiplied by the number of units sold of that product/service. 

$$\Large \text{Gross Revenue} = \text{Selling Price} \times \text{Number of Units Sold} $$

When the business pays the [[Indirect Tax\|Indirect Tax]] (like the [[Goods & Service Tax (GST)\|GST]]) owed to the Government, they left with [[Net Revenue\|Net Revenue]].

Net Revenue is mathematically calculated using the formula: $$\Large \text{Gross Revenue} - \text{Tax} = \text{Net Revenue}$$
