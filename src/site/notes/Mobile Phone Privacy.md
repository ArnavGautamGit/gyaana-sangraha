# Mobile Phone Privacy
> Maintaining [[Personal Online Privacy\|Personal Online Privacy]] on your Mobile Phone so that you can rest assured to not be able to be tracked much.

I will assume you have taken all steps discussed in the [[Personal Online Privacy\|Personal Online Privacy]] note along with the extra tips written at the bottom. I would also recommend following all of them.

### Privacy Screen Protector
This is particularly useful if you have nosy parents or if you frequenctly take Mass Transit.
Some of them come in the form of a full front & back cover but I feel I can get a much better option. Get one of those which offer it as a tempered glass which is tinted or polarised or both. It allows you to use specific back cover discussed ahead.

### Back Cover with Camera Protector
Those ones that have a slider which covers the area over the back camera so that the camea lenses can be protected has a dual use in stopping background apps from using your phone's back camera to spy on you since all they would see is a black screen.

### Front Camera Cover
There are many packs-of-3 or packs-of-6 webcam covers that are sold on as cheap as 1 USD or 99 INR on many online retailers as soon as you type "webcam blocker" or "webcam cover" in their search bar you will see 100s of such products.

### Mic Blocker or Faraday Cage Bag
If your phone has a 3.5 mm headphone jack in it, it is a great idea to instead of buying those 3.5 mm mic blockers specifically, it is easier to get those 3.5mm to 6.5mm adapters and then just connect the empty adapter to the 3.5 mm jack on your phone. Although, I have not tested it, the empty adapter trick should theoretically work... 
3.5mm mic blockers are at least more full proof & reassuring. 

If you want something more substantial in case your phone uses Type C with no headphone jack then you can opt for Faraday Bags that are obviously the best bet but you would not be able to use the screen either.

### Rewire your Operating System for Privacy
[[Android OS\|Android OS]] is a dumpsterfire of surveillance. Apple at least makes basic things such as encrypting your cloud backups via Advanced Data Protection into a toggle switch. Similarly Lockdown Mode (that can protect you against Nation-State actors) is also a toggle.

Best is to use a Google Pixel to load a custom ROM like [[Graphene OS\|Graphene OS]] on it. Why Graphene? Because as we learnt in [[Personal Online Privacy#First Step to Privacy - Compartmentalisation\|Compartmentalisation as the First Step to Online Privacy]] we saw that your life should be segregated. Now what if the OS segregated your apps into groups of profiles? A profile for google apps completely disconnected from your profile on pseudonymous social media and such.

[[Graphene OS\|Graphene OS]] can be coupled with an iPhone running Apple's latest [[iOS\|iOS]] version so that critical apps like the ones used for banking can work seamlessly (since not all apps work perfectly with Graphene OS) while stock/commercial [[Android OS\|Android OS]] should not even be on your list at all.

Read specific notes for [[Privacy on iPhone\|Privacy on iPhone]] and [[Privacy on Android\|Privacy on Android]] (coming soon) but I must say that Apple has trivialised privacy in the way that many privacy features are basically a toggle & easy to use.

### Reboot your phone more often
PIN is stored on RAM after first unlock to make unlocks faster. Reboots wipe the RAM memory and the data inside (specifically clicking "shut down" instead of "restart").

### Airplane Mode & Location Tracking
Blocks SIM service & SIM-based location tracking.
One that uses OpenStreetMap API like OsmAnd and other [[Free & Open Source Software (FOSS)\|FOSS]] navigation apps.
Mobile Apps like Google Maps share all your location history with their servers. You would probably not like to see all that stuff they have on you because it is truly scary how much they know and list for you to see (only if you know where to look).
