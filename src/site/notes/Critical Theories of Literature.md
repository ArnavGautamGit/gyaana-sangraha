# What are Critical Theories of Literature?
These are the Literary Theories which are used to educationally critique any literary work from any language or region. There are a few theories which are used extensively.
They are important as they allow us and guide us to study a literary text properly, understand character motivation, character depth, development, plots, sub-plots and how the story has affected the masses (also where the story has taken its inspirations from).
# List of Critical Theories of Literature
## Theory 1: Biographical Approach
- Views the literary piece from the lens of the Author's life or a particular character's life being mindful of the times it was written in but not caring too much about it either.
- An author's political, ideological viewpoints affect their work and it can be insightful to understand HOW and by HOW MUCH.
- Although it does help in art that is openly inspired from the author's life and political opinion, it often induces "The Intentional Fallacy" that everything in the work is intentional. Reducing and Restricting art to a specific time period and happenings of a specific person's life.
## Theory 2: New Historicism
- This school of critiquing Literature treats Literature as a piece of History and as an actor for the Historical Powers of the time.
- New Historicists assert that a piece of Literature does not exist outside its time and place and cannot be interpreted outside of its time and era. Hence, to interpret literature, New Historicists argue that they must keep in the back of their minds the time and era it was written.
- Readers are influenced by culture, hence no objective reading is possible. Critics should keep in mind how their own culture influences your reading.
- its called "New Historicism" since historically, losers are told to forget their past and move one. their stories are neither heard nor do they find audience for the said stories.
- Literature gives them a platform, and it is a very "new" thing to do.
## Theory 3: Feminism & Gender Approach
- The approach which is concerned about the genders of the characters.
- A good way to judge if a character or plot is alligned with the Feminist Approach is to check if it contains two female characters who talk about something other than a male. you will find in many literary works - especially the cinematic works - that lack this feature.
- The approach describes 3 stages of Feminism:
	- ***==Feminine==***: A woman is submissive according to the whims and fancies of the gender roles men have set for them.
	- ***==Feminist==***: Opposing men for the sake of opposition.
	- ***==Female==***: Does not care about Male definitions. Takes decisions consciously - whether right or wrong. She may agree or disagree with what he has to say.
## Theory 4 : Marxist Approach
- Ideas propagated by Karl Marx - Socialism, Communism etc.
- According to him soceity should be free of classes and castes.
- Karl Marx was born in Germany, by the way.
