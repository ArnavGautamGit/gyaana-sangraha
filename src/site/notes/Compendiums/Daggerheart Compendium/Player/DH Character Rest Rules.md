# DH Character Rest Rules
> Just like other games, Characters in [[Compendiums/Daggerheart Compendium/Daggerheart\|Daggerheart]] are also free to take Long Rests and Short Rests given that the [[Game Master (GM)\|GM]] agrees to this.

Character Rests in [[Compendiums/Daggerheart Compendium/Daggerheart\|Daggerheart]] are also governed by certain rules.
The Rules are as follows:
1. Characters cannot take rest while in combat.
2. Characters can make TWO Downtime Moves when resting.
3. Characters cannot make additional Downtime Moves unless an ability or feature allows them to.
4. Players have to describe each of their downtime moves.

### Downtime
Downtime is defined as the time while the characters are resting. Regardless of whether the rest is a Short Rest or a Long Rest, the moves the players can make are the same, only their affect changes.

The List of Downtime Player Moves are:
1. ***Tend to Wounds***: Patch up the wounds of your own or the wounds of an ally. In case of short rest, clear [[Compendiums/Daggerheart Compendium/General/Hit Point Slots\|Hit Point Slots]] equal to 1d4 + your tier. In case of a Long Rest, you can clear all marked HP Slots.
2. ***Clear Stress***: Either blow off steam or pull yourself together. In case of short rest, clear [[Compendiums/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Stress Point\|Stress Points]] 1d4 + your tier. In case of Long Rest, you can clear all marked Stress Points.
3. ***Repair Armour***: Either repair your own armour or help an ally repair theirs. Replenish [[Compendiums/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Armour Slots\|Armour Slots]] equal to 1d4 + your tier on Short Rests and replenish ALL marked Armour Slots on a Long Rest.
4. ***Prepare***: You prepare for the oncoming path ahead and gain 1x [[Hope Token\|Hope Token]]. If you plan with one or more allies, each of you gains 2x [[Hope Token\|Hope Token]].

### Downtime Consequences
The world does not stop during the character downtime!
The GM can also make Downtime Moves.
The [[Game Master (GM)\|Game Master (GM)]] is entitled to advance a relevant long-term countdown (if any).
- In case of a Short Rest taken by the players, the GM gains [[Compendiums/Daggerheart Compendium/General/Fear Token\|Fear Token]] equal to the result of a 1d4 dice roll. 
- In case of a Long Rest taken by the players, the GM gains [[Compendiums/Daggerheart Compendium/General/Fear Token\|Fear Token]] equal to the result of 1d4 dice roll + Total Number of Players.

### Character Projects in Downtime
If a PC wants to pursue a project that would take them a substantial amount of time but that they can work on during a long rest, they should first discuss it with the GM. This could involve deciphering an ancient text, crafting a new weapon, or something similar.

Projects usually involve a Progress Countdown (see the “Countdowns” section on page 162). Each time a PC takes the Work on a Project downtime move during a long rest, they either automatically tick down their countdown, or the GM might ask them to make an action roll to gauge their progress.

See Page 181 of the Core Rulebook for more info.

### Refreshing Features
Resting will refresh the features of the characters unless they are once-per-session features which only refresh at the end of a session. If a scene carry forwards to the next session like a "next time on Daggerheart" kind of advertisement, then the features refresh on the next scene.

Any features or effects that last till your "next rest" or short rest refresh at any rest either long rest or short rest BUT IF a feature is set to refresh at a long rest, it will only refresh at a long rest.
