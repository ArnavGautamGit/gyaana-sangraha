# Who is Veer Savarkar?
Originally born *'Vinayak Damodar Savarkar'* was an Indian Politician, author and a revolutionary. He was the man who coined the term Hindutva (or atleast made it maintream) and gave Hindus a model to fight politically and increase unity among Hindus.
Although his full understanding can only be understood through a book, this is an attempt to summarise his glorious life.

# His Political Views
He was of the view that Hindus must unite under 1 flag and terminate the differences among them. He wasn't against the various diverse Sampradāya of the Hindu Society but against the divisions which he called the [[7 shackles of Hindu Society\|7 shackles of Hindu Society]].
He was also against Cow Worship and Vegetarianism. He argued that if someone wants to stay away from meat by their own free will and discretion then it is completely fine but saying that someone with some specific type of diet is better than the other is stupid. 
Although I agree with the point on Cow Worship that we should treat the animal dear, yes... but not to overdo it. I disagree with Savarkar on Vegetarianism, if someone believes something is helping their spiritual journey then why guilt-trip them? I believe he was talking about those who force vegetarianism on others and if it is so, then I agree that forcing your opinion on anyone is wrong.

# Contributions to Indian Independence
- Reading and Understanding og his books were used as the eligibility criteria for entry into the HSRA since Bhagat Singh and his fellow revolutionaries were highly impressed and influenced of his ideas.
- Inspired Subash Chandra Bose to add British Indian Army Soldiers currently held in Germany as Prisoners of War to his Azad Hind Fauj (Indian National Army) after talking to Hitler. Also, to then take the help of the Rash Behari Bose in the Japanese Imperial Army to launch an attack against the British.

These points are elaborated further in the lower section of this note. Also check Footnotes for sources.

# Allegations of being a British Stooge
The narrative set by Congress and left that Savarkar was a British Stooge is an absolute lie. People still today write lies based on this narrative. 
Example: this article by "The Wire" is malicious as hell - [BS Wire Article](https://thewire.in/history/veer-savarkar-the-staunchest-advocate-of-loyalty-to-the-english-government)

## The Wire's article destroyed by Firstpost
From the wire article - "_At the time when Subhas Chandra Bose was raising his Indian National Army to confront the British in India, Savarkar helped the colonial government recruit lakhs of Indians into its armed forces."_

Savarkar was in favor of militarization and wanted Indians to be trained in the military so he encouraged them to join the British army get trained and then use this training for India's self-defense against the colonizers.

Moreover, he helped Bose with INA —Bose and Savarkar had a meeting in June 1940. A suggestion was made to Bose by Savarkar that he should leave India and go to Germany to organize the Indian forces there fallen in German hands as captives and then with German help proceed to Japan to join hands with Rash Behari Bose. To impress this point, Savarkar showed Bose a letter from Rash Behari to Savarkar written just on the eve of the Japanese declaration of war. [[Veer Savarkar#^1\|#^1]]

This is exactly what Bose did after six months. If Savarkar was a British stooge then why would Bose go to him for suggestion?

## Savarkar's Mercy Petitions
This was a routine affair at that time. Many revolutionaries wrote petitions like these including Tilak, MM Malviya, and Sachyindra Sanyal. Gandhi himself wrote a petition to the British on behalf of the Savarkar brothers.

If Savarkar was a British stooge then why would Bhagat Singh use copies of Savarkar's 1857 independence book & Life of Savarkar as entry criteria for members to HSRA? The copies of this book were found in raids on all members of HSRA accused in the Lahore Conspiracy case.

Bhagat Singh quoted Savarkar in his jail diary many times and was inspired by him. All this happened many years after the mercy petition. [[Veer Savarkar#^2\|#^2]]

## Logical Fallacies in allegations
If Savarkar was a British stooge then why would they extend his imprisonment post-1924 so many times? Whenever any other revolutionaries did something Savarkar's punishment would be increased or he would be put in Jail fearing his involvement. E.g. - When Kakori happened he was imprisoned and his house was raided many times. Why would the British do this if he was truly loyal to them?

Some people say he was being paid by the British. He was being paid a pension which was a right of every Kaala Paani prisoner. Even this pension was delayed by many years and only 60 rs per month was paid instead of 100 rs which should have been paid.

The British took away all his degrees so he could not find employment anywhere. He was a barrister and had studied at Ferguson College, Pune, and later in London. Post Kaala pani the family had no real source of income and lived in poverty. Why would the Brits take away his degrees if he was loyal to them?

Savarkar's brother was burned alive by Gandhi supporters during the Brahmin Genocide after Godse shot Gandhi.

There are so many lies and false narratives peddled by Congress and the left on Savarkar and people are sadly gobbling it without any verification. ***I am grateful to Vikram Sampath's work on Savarkar*** which has truly rattled many. Nothing has left "the left" more clueless than Sampath's book in recent times.

_For people questioning Savarkar's Idea of Hindutva. This is what he wrote in his book Essentials of Hindudtva in 1923._

> Savarkar used the term "Hindutva" to describe "Hinduness" or the "quality of being a Hindu". Savarkar regarded Hinduism as an ethnic, cultural, and political identity. Hindus, according to Savarkar, are those who consider India to be the land in which their ancestors lived, as well as the land in which their religion originated: "one for whom India is both Fatherland and Holyland".

_**Sarvakar includes all Indian religions in the term "Hinduism" and outlines his vision of a "Hindu Rashtra" (Hindu Nation) as "Akhand Bharat" (Unified India), stretching across the entire Indian subcontinent**_
