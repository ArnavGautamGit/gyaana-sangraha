# Expansion P-Box
> A [[P-Box\|P-Box]] which increases the number of output bits. The P in P-Box stands for Permutation.

P-Boxes are usually used for deterministically shuffling the bits.
Here, it is used to not just shuffle but also increase the number of output bits.

### Working
The P-Box has $\large n$ number of input bits and $\large m$ number of output bits, so it would always have total $\large m$ number of entries (using repetition of entries) to achieve this.
