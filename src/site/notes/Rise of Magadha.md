# Rise of Magadha
> Historical period where the Magadha Mahajanpada of the [[Indian Vedic Period\|Indian Vedic Period]] rose to power as one of the most wealthy mahajanpadas.

Under the rule of [[Bimbisāra\|Bimbisāra]], Magadha attacked and won over the Central Indian Mahajanpada of Avanti (with its capitals in Ujjain and Mahishmati).

Soon under [[Ajātashatru\|Ajātashatru]] and [[Shishunāga\|Shishunāga]], Magadha was able to defeat Chedi mahajanpada in southern Gangetic Plains until the reign of the first empire-builder [[Mahapadma Nanda\|Mahapadma Nanda]] who laid the foundation for the [[Nanda Empire\|Nanda Empire]] by defeating ALL and EVERY Mahajanapada in the Indian Subcontinent. 

Eventually, under [[Dhana Nanda\|Dhana Nanda]], some of the territories went independent as the empire and the surroundings experienced changes - similar to how Poros's territory got independent.

Since all the empires from [[Bimbisāra\|Bimbisāra]], [[Ajātashatru\|Ajātashatru]], [[Nanda Empire\|Nandas]], [[Mauryan Empire\|Mauryas]], [[Shunga Dynasty\|Shungas]] and [[Kanvavamsha Dynasty\|Kanvas]] all ruled from Magadha with Pataliputra as the capital, they are all considered as Kings or rulers of the Magadha Empire.
