# Chauffeur Knowledge
> Surface-level Knowledge gained for putting up a show or facade about being generally Intelligent or especially knowledgable in a subject.

The name of this phenomenon is drawn from the old story of [[Max Planck\|Max Planck]] and his Chauffeur (Driver). Mr. Planck had delivered the same lecture so many times in various colleges that his Chauffeur had memorised the entire speech. But if asked a question outside of the prepared speech - he would go silent.

The meaning is that the people with this kind of Knowledge cannot speak a word outside their pre-written script.

### Avoidance
Avoid becoming like the Chauffeur by:
1. Sticking to your circle of Competance - know the boundaries of your knowledge. There is no shame to admit you don't know everything.
2. Unapologetically Admit that you are not the all-knowing God.
