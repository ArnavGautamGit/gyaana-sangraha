# Covert Operations
Definition:
> It is an operation or mission where concealment of the agency sponsoring the mission is sought. The evidence must be against the spy (if they are caught) & never against the agency.
> ~ *The Unending Game*, page 15 (rephrased)

Concealing the trail to the sponsor is possible by the use of proxy fighters so the organisation can deny involvement since they aren't their fighters or their state's fighters. Moreover, it will not be possible (legally) to find out out transactions from one country's intel organisation's agent/tresurer's account to the proxy fighters - so other Intelligence Organisations may know but cannot reveal the same to the general public without exposing their assets & positioning of said assets.

### When Should a Covert Option be considered?
- Leader from another country is not willing to tajke a supportive stance and threatens the nation & hence the threat needs to be neutralised by Assassinating the said leader.
- Initiate a regime change by either assassination or public uprising or public/government vote.
- Psychological Warfare - changing opinions of who is the friend or foe of a certain country. For example, Indian Intelligence Officers from the R&AW influencing the political leadership and the public of Sikkim to join Republic of India.
- Cyber Warfare - destroy & take out any enemy computers or digital systems by the use of Malware like [[Code Red (Worm)\|Code Red (Worm)]] and [[Stuxnet (Worm)\|Stuxnet (Worm)]]
