# Cipher
> [[Cryptographic Encryption Algorithms\|Cryptographic Encryption Algorithms]] which can encrypt and decrypt the data in the same logical sequence regardless of programming language used to program them.

The words "same logical sequence" refer to the fact that the same algorithm used for encryption can be used for decryption. Most Algorithms reverse the order of steps required in encryption than decryption but it is still the same sequence.

To check if a  text is encrypted or not, we could import a dictionary of English Language Words and check if most words (above 95%) correspond to the dictionary, it is to be encrypted, else it is to be decrypted.
