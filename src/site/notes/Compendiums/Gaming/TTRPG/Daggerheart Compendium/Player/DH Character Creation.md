[[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/DH Character Creation#Domain Cards\|Domain Cards]]

### Character Class
Each Class has Class Foundations (Sub-classes) and all classes have two Domains that overlap among classes in a circular fashion. When creating a character, the player needs to select one of the given Class Foundations and a number of Domain Cards (calculated from their character level). 

Each Class also has a Special Hope Ability that utilises 3x [[Hope Token\|Hope Token]] to do something special. Not to mention any two characters can strike off 3x Hope Tokens each to attack a specific enemy together at the same time like a Tag-Team.

Each Class has an extra choice of "Class Item" which is a special non-combat item that helps in building the story. Class Items can be homebrewed freely as long as they are unusable in combat.

Multi-classing in 2 or more classes (max 3) is allowed as per [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/DH Multiclassing Rules\|DH Multiclassing Rules]].

### Character Heritage
Heritage of Characters is based on combining the [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Ancestries/DH Species Ancestry\|DH Species Ancestry]] and the strata of society (reflected by [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/DH Community Heritage\|DH Community Heritage]]) the character was born in.

Choose one of both and then write them in your sheet as "Community Species".
Example: "[[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/DH Community Heritage#Highborne\|Highborne]] [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Ancestries/Human (DH)\|Human]]"

### Character Traits
All the traits: [[Agility\|Agility]], [[Strength\|Strength]], [[Finesse\|Finesse]], [[Instinct\|Instinct]], [[Presence\|Presence]] and [[Knowledge\|Knowledge]] require to be given modifiers, there are no absolute scores - just modifiers.

Modifiers are assigned from the standard array of: +2, +1, +1, 0, 0, -1.
Any of the numbers can be assigned to any of the traits. 
So, one of the traits must be +2, two must be +1 each and one must be -1 and the remaining others are 0. Any trait can be given any modifier, some players may like +2 strength, others may like -1 totally depends on player preference and the class they want to use.

### Starting Equipment
At the start of the game, each character can choose their character's armour type, primary weapon & an optional secondary weapon.

Armour Type will affect the total number of [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Armour Slots\|Armour Slots]] and also depending upon how bulky the chosen armourset is, it may also change the [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Evasion Score\|Evasion Score]]. Only one Armour Slot can be used against an attack. The use of Armour immediately reduces damage to a lower damage threshold.

Weapons may (and generally do) have special features that alter the [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/DH Character Creation#Character Traits\|Traits]] so be sure to update the values! It is advised to write your [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Armour Score\|Armour Score]] and [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Evasion Score\|Evasion Score]] last since Armour Scores can changed based on [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/DH Character Creation#Character Class\|Character Class and Subclass]].

### Additional Character Information
Now is the time to finalise your [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Evasion Score\|Evasion Score]]! Starting Evasion Score is different from Class to Class and you can easily add or subtract any modifiers from armour or weapons into your evasion score.

### Character Background
Create and Add a Character Backstory - please give this to your DM as well so they can use it to craft the story with parts of your character's story as a [[Plot Twist\|twist]] or test. There are a few Background Questions that are included in the sheet and may aid you in Backstory Creation or add to the Bakstory.

### Character Experiences
These are small phrases or pieces of wisdom your character has accumulated that they can use through the campaign.

![DH Character Experiences.png](/img/user/Vaulted%20Images/DH%20Character%20Experiences.png)

To use these Experiences, you will also have to describe how to the said experience helps you in the scenario. 
You have to spend 1 [[Hope Token\|Hope Token]] to use 1 Experience - if the [[Game Master (GM)\|Game Master (GM)]] agrees with your experience being useful.

You can add more experiences as you level up.

### Connections (Optional)
Optional if the party members want to do something like this. Not important. Not helpful. It is basically a section where if you are supposed to know another member of the party before hand, you wirte their name and how you know them in this section.

### Domain Cards
Number of Domain Cards are decided by the character levels and you can carry a maximum of 5 in your loadout + few extras dependent on level.

If you wamt to switch out Domain Cards, each Card has a [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Stress Point\|Stress Point]] indicator, you can mark off the number of Stess Points the new card (which was outside your Loadout) and swap that with another card of the same Domain. This is where 0 stress cards come in handy. They may not be as strong, but when you need them specifically, those cards can be swapped in at 0 Stress Points.

The Kind of Domain Cards you have is dependent on your [[Domains in Daggerheart (DH)\|Domain]] - which is influenced by your [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/DH Character Creation#Character Class\|#Character Class]]. You are only able to take 1 domain from a class if you multi-class. See [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/DH Multiclassing Rules\|DH Multiclassing Rules]] for more info. This means that you can only get domain cards for that domain.

### Character Levelling
Character Levelling is based on four tiers.
1. Level 1 is considered Tier 1
2. ***Tier 2***: Level 2 to Level 4
3. ***Tier 3***: Level 5 to Level 7
4. ***Tier 4***: Level 8 to Level 10

At each Tier any character gains, the character is given the following:
- The Character is allowed to take another [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/DH Character Creation#Character Experiences\|Character Experience]].
- The character is given one [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Proficiency\|Proficiency]] i.e., if the character was rolling nd6 for their weapon, they will now role (n+1) number of d6 dice.
- On getting to Tier 3 and Tier 4 (i.e., on Level 5 and Level 8) all players can clear all marks on Character Traits and choose to increase them again on any level up.
