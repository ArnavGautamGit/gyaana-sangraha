# Opportunity Cost
> A Benefit which the businessman has missed out on due to choosing a different option or opportunity. That poor choice (or loss of opportunity) acts as a cost to Profit.

For Example: Praveen decides on prioritising fun over studying one subject or the other for upcoming exams. Opportunity Cost here will be in terms of marks lost due to the weaker preparation for a subject.

Hence in Business & in Life, Opportunity Cost should be kept as minimum as possible. One should take informed & correct decision with a future vision in life.
