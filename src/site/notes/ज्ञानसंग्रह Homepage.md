# Welcome to ज्ञानसंग्रह !!

ज्ञानसंग्रह is a Sanskrit name formed by the concatenation of two Sanskrit Words: 
1. ज्ञान (Knowledge or Wisdom) 
2. संग्रह (Repository)

Putting them together you can easily understand that this is a Knowledge Repository which I use for learning in public and simultaneously backing up my notes via GitHub.

You are free to press Ctrl+K (or Cmd+K for Mac Users) to open the Search bar & search for a specific item or note if you want to look for something specific or click on the Menu icon on the top left to open the list of notes to check them out! 

Please ignore the chaos in the sidebar menu since organising this now will require me to manually move 1000+ notes into respective folders, not to mention first creating and sorting said folders. I have already began this painstaking process.

The chaos in the menu icon has now begun to help me since no one that truly has a life or a job will be free enough to try and look through the entire collection of notes unless their job involves attacking, troubling, defaming or at the very least spying on me. 

If you are here to hire me? Please look at [[My Résumé\|My Résumé]].
Else, please keep reading.

# Intro to the संग्रह (Repository)
I am a proud Indian who believes that Sanskrit is the way of reviving the unity of my country which lays fractured in the wake of Internet Echo Chambers.
As a proud Sanskrit-learner I have divided the entire Repository into a Sanskrit Theme. At the same time, if you want to explore more, you can check the [[Learning Sanskrit\|Learning Sanskrit]] note.

The primary language of the Repository is English for the reason that English is the language of the Internet and insures maximum penetration in the same. 
I would have loved to make notes in Sanskrit but only 73,000 or so people would understand it. (As of the 2011 Census of India,the number of Sanskrit speakers in India are around 73,000)

I would not call myself a polymath, but I will say that I am trying my best to become one.
