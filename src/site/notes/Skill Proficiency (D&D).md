# Skill Proficiency (D&D)
> Most [[D&D d20 Tests\|D&D d20 Tests]] require a skill. Proficiency decides whether the character in question is proficient in the skill or not. If yes, they may add the proficiency bonus of that skill to the D20 roll as a modifier.

Each Skill is based on one of the Ability Stats.
For example, Athletics is based on Strength and Acrobatics is based on Dexterity.

> [!tip] Tip: Proficiency Bonus does not stack!
> If the [[Dungeon Master (DM)\|Dungeon Master (DM)]] has not specified that the skill but just named the ability. For Example, if the DM said to make a Charisma check, the player could add the proficiency bonus of either Deception or Persuasion - but not the sum of both.

## List of Skills
This is the full list of Skills that is also present on character sheets but example uses are more helpful for a [[Dungeon Master (DM)\|Dungeon Master (DM)]] running the game of [[Compendiums/D&D Compendium/Dungeons & Dragons\|D&D]] for their players.

> [!tip] Tip: DM's Discretion for using a different Ability Stat for a skill check
> If the player feels that the skill can be used with a different ability, it is on DM's descretion whether the DM might allow you to apply your skill proficiency to a different ability check. For example, if a character tries to intimidate someone through a show of physical strength, the DM might ask for a Strength (lntimidation) check rather than a Cha risma (lntimidation) check. That character would make a Strength check and add their Proficiency Bonus if they have lntimidation proficiency.
