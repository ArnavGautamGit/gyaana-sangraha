# The Forgotten Forest
The server I stumbled upon when I was looking for [[The Wandering Realm (TWR)\|TWR]] D&D server.

Lore:
- Mysterious Forest - has various locations.
- Sylwood is named after Syl - who recently came back from the dead.
- The forest is similar but not the same as the concept of a plateau surrounded by abyss on all sides...
- The forest tries to kill all inhabitants except the things part of the forest - such as river, plants, grass and trees.

My Character:
[[Valyrion Amathyst\|Valyrion Amathyst]]
