# Chinese Investment into Hambantota Port
> An investment project signed by the Sri Lankan Government giving authorisation to the Chinese Government in sending their workers and invest their money into redevloping the Hambantota Port as a major deep sea port.

The Chinese showed Sri Lankans some massive dreams of how the Park Strait sees massive amounts of traffic & serves many countries. I won't blame Sri Lankans in this matter since the Chinese helped them fight against the [[Tamil Tigers\|Tamil Tigers]] Terrorist Group while India didn't because it may make Indian Tamils angry & it may somehow reduce BJPs voteshare in Tamil Nadu. 
(BJP scores 0 seats in TN)

Sri Lankans probably did not ask how a port on the southern end of Sri Lanka (opposite side of the Palk Strait) would actually divert enough traffic to make a profit. The Port ended up in not making any profits since ships go through the strait to not take the massive detour around Sri Lanka & pay entry fee into the Sri Lankan [[Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ)\|Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ)]] i.e., ships specifically go through the strait to avoid the very detour the port tried serving to. 

Needless to say, things got dire enough that schools in Sri Lanka had to postpone or cancel exams since there was a shortage of paper itself! They didn't even have the money left to import paper.

With the inability to repay the loans, Sri Lanka was forced to give China 70% shares in the redeveloped port to China & take the port on a 99 year lease.
