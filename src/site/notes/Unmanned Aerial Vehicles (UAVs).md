# Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)
> Refers to remotely piloted or completely autonomous flying vehicles which may emulate Helicopters or Planes in design.

Unlike popular belief & also unlike the reasoning of Janardhan sir, the word unmanned does not always mean autonomous here.
Most of the time, there are humans that are giving the control inputs. Its called "unmanned" because there is no pilot physically sitting in any cockpit inside the vehicle.

UAVs are considered revolutionary because wars can take place without risking as many human lives with equipmet which can be manufactured for much cheaper.

### Classification of UAVs
UAVs can be classified on the basis of the following criteria:
- Usecase (Civilian or Military)
- Design (Fixed Wing or Multi-Rotor)
- Propulsion (Electric or Fossil Fuel)

### Components of UAVs
Many controllers such as [[PID Controller\|PID Controller]] and [[Kalman Filter\|Kalman Filter]] (which has subtypes such as [[Extended Kalman Filter\|Extended Kalman Filter]] among others).
