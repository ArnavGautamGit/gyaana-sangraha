# D&D Ancestries
> Note listing out all the ancesties in the Corebooks like [[Compendiums/D&D Compendium/Corebooks/D&D Player's Handbook\|D&D Player's Handbook]] and other Additional Books for D&D 2024 that may be released over a period of time.

For the extent of this note, we will stick to the D&D Ancestry Options in [[D&D Character Creation\|Character Creation]] to the options available in the [[Compendiums/D&D Compendium/Corebooks/D&D Player's Handbook\|PHB]] - if otherwise, I will write the source book's name and exact chapter & page number as necessary to quote.

As for now, the word "Species" is preferred by the 2024 [[Compendiums/D&D Compendium/Corebooks/D&D Player's Handbook\|D&D Player's Handbook]] and older editions used the word "Race". I prefer the term "Ancestry" so that it does not send the message to the players that people of different "species" cannot even theoretically procreate together.

### Parts of an Ancestry or Species
This part is taken from the first few pages of Chapter 4 of the Handbook.
Any ancestry MUST (and generally does) grant these following things to the players to keep the character creation process rolling:
1. ***Creature Type***: Humanoid or otherwise (among other types as given in Rules Glossary of the handbook)
2. ***Size***: Small, Medium and Large along with the general physical build & stature.
3. ***Movement Speed***: How much can you move in one turn without using the Dash Action.
4. ***Special Traits***: Each species gives a character special traits-unique characteristics based on the species' physiology or magical nature. When you choose a species, your character gets all the special traits listed for it. Some traits involve making a choice from a handful of options.

### List of Ancestries Available
Most of the Ancestries in D&D (as discussed past Page 185 of the Player's Handbook) have many sub-types. The only reason links have been provided here to keep track and being able to avoid writing the same stuff over and over.

Some Links may get filled out if a player is playing that Ancestry and I may need to keep notes handy so I will prepare some notes along the way.

### Mixed Ancestries
I could not find anything specific in the [[Compendiums/D&D Compendium/Corebooks/D&D Player's Handbook\|D&D Player's Handbook]] for this topic but feel free to correct me if anything in the 2024 rules did indeed mention them and I have overlooked something.
