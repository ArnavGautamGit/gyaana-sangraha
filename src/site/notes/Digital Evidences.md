# Digital Evidences
> Items and Data such as system logs, call logs, timestamped messages, social media activity or other data or meta data that can act as evidence to prove a [[Cyber Crime\|Cyber Crime]] or [[Malicious Hacking\|Malicious Hacking]] case in court.

Evidences and their forms may change depending on the Operating System used by the user. Linux Filesystem is ext4 whereas NTFS is primarily used by Windows while Mac uses HFS+. FAT32 is also used by Windows but generally considered cross-platform.

Evidence is often collected in the form of files copied from the filesystem or as [[Computer Artefacts\|Computer Artefacts]] of various operating systems. Often [[Browser Artefacts\|Browser Artefacts]] are also a great source of data.

Users may use [[Whole Disk Encryption\|Whole Disk Encryption]] to protect against their data being seen, read, edited or deleted by another person outside of the circle of authorised people who know the password. 

the process of collection of Digital Evidences depend on whether the forensic analysis is done as [[Live Forensics\|Live Forensics]] or [[Dead Forensics\|Dead Forensics]].

### Maintaining the Chain of Custody
An important step in Collection of Digital Evidence. 
In the step, we are expected to document everything so it is easy to conduct a Forensic Analysis in case things actualy go south. Not to mention that the court requires immensely detailed logs of all investigative steps to accept any digital evidence presented. The Documentation helps in reproducibility & tracking the investigation process if any other experts want to reproduce our results using the same processes.


We must use Tamper-proof storage with clear labels and keep them properly sealed and limit access to authorised personnel only.

To preserve the evidence and maintain Data [[Integrity\|Integrity]], we should always maintain Hash Values of the storage drives. In terms of approach to handle evidence we shoud use the approach of Acquire, Authenticate and Analyse.
