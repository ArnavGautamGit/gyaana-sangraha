# Transitioning between targets is not easy
According to the book *'The Unending Game'* by Vikram Sood, the former chief of [[R&AW\|R&AW]]:
Collecting Intelligence takes time, assets and officers need to be briefed and taught about the target country, its people, establishment, culture, insights and the short-term and long-term goals in the country - the method of communication with the home country etc. Not to mention, the agent also needs to be trained & given time to acclimatize in the environment.

Mr. Sood uses the example of the transition from the Cold War into the 2000s:
> "from having spent millions with years of inputs to train linguists and area and subject experts in communism, for instance, agencies were left with little capacity to handle new evolving threats, such as Islamic terrorism."
> ~ *'The Unending Game'* page 7

While in the 1980s and the 1990s, they (The West) ignored the threats in rising Jihad and Islamic Radicalism in the world because they were dealing with The Cold War... in the 2000s they had no information about Islam in detail and infact, The USA and the West in general used to call Terrorism in Kashmir as a "law & order issue" in the 90s until the [[9/11 terrorist attack\|9/11 terrorist attack]] happened in 2001...

The Intelligene teams now have to spend a lot of time, energy and money to train their assets & move to a different threat which is miles different from anything they had seen. Also the fact that they have to do all this at a faster pace than before! Only [[MOSSAD\|MOSSAD]] and [[R&AW\|R&AW]] were probably equipped for such missions, since the USA had better ties with Israel and Pakistan than they had wityh India, they chose to take the help of Mossad instead.
