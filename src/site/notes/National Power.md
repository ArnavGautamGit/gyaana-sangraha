# National Power
> Also known as "State Power".
> It is a concept in [[International Studies\|International Studies]] which is used as a way to measure the strength of a [[State (United Nations)\|State]] with the objective being to compare the State-in-question with another either to find the stronger of the two or the strongest state on the planet.

The concept is said to have [[National Power#Tangible Elements\|Tangible Elements]] and [[National Power#Intangible Elements\|Intelangible Elements]] to it & is defined in different ways by various Philosophers who subscribed to their unique philosophies.

Generally it is observed that National Power is developed by the State to safeguard their [[National Interest\|National Interest]] although it may be used beyond the very same.

### Alternative Definitions
> "Psychological Relation between those who exercise it and those on whom it is exercised."
> *[[Hans Morgenthau\|Hans Morgenthau]], Philosopher who created the [[Morgenthau's Realism\|Morgenthau's Realism]]*

> "Capacity to impose one's will on another by reliance on effective sanctions in the case of non-compliance."
> *[[Georg Schwarzenberger\|Georg Schwarzenberger]] defines State Power*

for other popular definitions fpr State Power, please check the slides provided by Professor George Kutty sir. He has a slide which lists these definitions and quotes from eminent personalities in International Politics who define State Power in their own way.
### Tangible Elements
Elements that can be scientifically measured to a great degree of accuracy and precision & reliance on estimates is minimal.
It includes any Reserves of Natural Resources, the State's Economy and the State's Military Size & Strength to name a few. Alliances are also considered if they are governed by a charter or document.

### Intangible Elements
Elements that cannot be measured scientifically to any significant degree and we have to stick to estimates of State Morale & Diplomat Quality or abstract concepts such as a state's Ideology & Nationalism. 

### My Views and Philosophy
Minimum Amount of National Power that the Nation must have is with respect to defending the State's people, their livelihood & machinery such as governments.

What defines as defensive and offensive power? What differentiates them? Should the policy of "Offence is the best form of Defence" be used here? Would that give the state unlimited powers to expand & encompass all happenings (even in other states) as a possible threat to the state's [[National Interest\|National Interest]]?

National Power must be preemptive in nature. The information of any possible threats must arrive preemptively but preemptive strikes must be avoided unless the other state has been hostile quite openly.

As an example, Israel making a preemptive strike against Iran is still pardonable due to the latter being openly hostile to the former & the world could see how Iran had it coming. In case of India & China, preemptive strikes must be avoided since both states do not exactly want the worse for the other rather just want a harmless and friendly government in the other state.
