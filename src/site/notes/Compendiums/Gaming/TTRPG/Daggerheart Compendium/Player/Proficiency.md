# Proficiency
> Proficiency is defined as the total number of dice rolled when using weapons or spells to achieve the target in [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/Daggerheart\|Daggerheart]].

All characters start at a proficiency of 1, which may increase from there to be 2 when the character levels up to level 2 or uses a specific Subclass Feature which temporarily boosts proficiency.

On the character sheet, Proficiency often is depicted by dots over the weapons section that need to be filled in for each level one goes up.
