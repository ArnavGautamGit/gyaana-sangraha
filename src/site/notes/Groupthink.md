# Groupthink
> Special type of [[Social Proof\|Social Proof]] where members of a (generally long-running) closely connected group form unified opinions which only an outsider can break since insiders are consciously or subconsciously scared of "breaking the unity" and being the naysayer - said outsider is also met with massive wave of resistance.

Groupthink and Social Proof can stem from the [[Authority Bias\|Authority Bias]] or the homogeneity of the group - including but not limited to homogeneity in ideas & opinions on most topics.

The group runs on the belief that if everyone agrees and the leader (if there is one) also agrees then any denier must be wrong.

Example, if I started talking about [[Dr. Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar#Ambedkar's Dark Side\|Dr. Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar#Ambedkar's Dark Side]] in a college or university where people do not know me much - people will look at me with a weird disdane.

### Avoidance
When in a tight unanimous group - speak your mind even if the team and leader does not like you doing that. If you are the leader, appoint a Devil's Advocate - they'll be hated so pay them more to keep the incentive of actually staying in the group/company.
