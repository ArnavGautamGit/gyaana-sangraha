# Agile Software Methodology
> Agile Methodology and their derivative models are the latest techniques we use in the field of [[Software Engineering\|Software Engineering]].

Agile Methods and the derivative models were based on the principle that software was built on the foundation of clear communication, strong understanding and solid cooperation between the developers and the stakeholders instead of JUST being able to convey requirements.

### Core Methodolgy
Agile Methodology believes in the following:
- Use working code and prototypes versus documentation.
- Rely on early developer test case development versus separate test functions.
- Design for one feature at a time versus complete design.
- Produce many small releases fixing small bugs versus a limited number of larger releases trying to fix many bugs in one go.

### Principles
1. ***==Customer Involvement==***: Customer must be heavily involved in the building of a Software they want to use.
2. ***==Incremental Delivery==***: Software is built in increments with the customer specifying requirements in each increment.
3. ***==People-Focused (not Process-Focused)==***: Unique Skills of the developers need to be employed, skills of the people define the team i.e., a team should not be forced to learn new skills for a project, we should instead appoint those members who are already skilled/familiar with the programming language, stack, library etc.
4. ***==Embrace Change==***: Allow and welcome changes in the requirements since they will not be impacted by them.
5. ***==Maintain Simplicity==***: Actively work to eliminate complexity in the system wherever possible.

### Weaknesses
1. Team members may be unsuited to the intense involvement that characterizes agile methods.
2. Prioritizing changes can be difficult where multiple stakeholders are involved.
