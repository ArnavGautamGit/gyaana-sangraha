# TTRPG Campaigns
> A collection of TTRPG Campaigns hosted by me using pre-made or customs [[TTRPG Settings\|Settings]] and custom [[Table-Top Role-Playing Game\|TTRPG Systems]] 

Below this paragraph you would see an embedded Obsidian Bases `.base` file and it may or may not load properly for the people viewing these notes from a website view. Some like the "Flaming Lotus" may also be listed as a Setting as well as a Campaign because it is a special one set in a modified setting of real-world medieval Asia.
