# Russia's Sukhoi SU-57 'Felon'
After the [[ATF project\|ATF project]] of the USAF & building its own 5th-Gen Air Superiority Fighter named the [[ Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor\| Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor]], it was Russia's turn to build its own 5th-Gen fighter.
When in 2010, Russia was seen testing out the SU-57's early development model everyone claimed it was just a copycat of the American F-22.

Yes it did have the same Diamond Wings as the F-22 but the overall nose & wing profile of the jet seemed more similar to the [[Northrop YF-23 Concept\|Northrop YF-23 Concept]] mixed with its own Flanker design of other Sukhoi jets like the [[Sukhoi SU-27 Flanker\|Sukhoi SU-27 Flanker]]. It is interesting to note that the YF-23 also had Diamond WIngs

In this picture above we can see that the SU-57's stabilizers may be more erect but the YF-23 had forgone rudders in the stabilizers for an extreme cantered design. SU-57 plays it safe with keeping the rudders and a less aggressive design. It is unknown which design philosophy is better.

> Note that the YF-23 is said to have been rejected by the USAF due to some corruption and many Northrop Engineers saying that the YF-23 could destroy the F-22 very easily.

Another thing to note is the use of LERX (Leading Edge Root Extensions) control surfaces which can be used as Canards for Dogfighting prowess.

Many think that Dogfighting will be useless in the future with improved Stealth but that is not really true. If Stealth improves so will the defensive weapons at some point. The inflection point hasn't happened yet but if there are alternate ways of detecting aircrafts or improvements in RADAR technology, the jets will have to fly lower to avoid detection and their [[BVR (Beyond Visual Range)\|BVR (Beyond Visual Range)]] combat effectiveness and take a hit and Dogfights may become a reality.

In terms of Stealth capability, where F-35 has a [[RCS (RADAR Cross-section)\|RCS (RADAR Cross-section)]] of 0.06 square metres without [[RAM (RADAR Absorbing Materials)\|RAM (RADAR Absorbing Materials)]] coating which enables stealth. With the Stealth (RAM) coating, it lowers down to 0.001 (if fully covered which they aren't)

According to a leaked document produced by the source given in the footnotes, it is estimated that the RCS of SU-57 without the coatings is between 0.5-1 square metres (which is roughly the same as India's [[HAL Tejas\|HAL Tejas]]). Another team was doing the RCS simulation testing of famous jets of the world and found that the SU-57 without RAM coatings could go to 0.48 sq. metres of but with RAM coatings near important areas could get to 0.2.... which is still 3 times that of the uncovered F-35, but still very lethal. 

### Design Weaknesses
The main weakness lies in the engines. A big chunk of them are exposed including their Titanium parts. Titaniuym reflects RADAR signatures well and can make this jet very visible from the back.

A lot of the rotating fans inside the Air Intake Ducts (known as S-Ducts due to their cross section looking like an S from the intake on the underbelly to the top of the engine) are also visible on the jet - something that was hidden in all of the previous iterations of Russian aircrafts. Considering the engines are on the back side of the jet, it can be considered as something that can be overlooked since the enemy will only see the frontal RCS. 
Another thing about the engines is that they are taken from the older SU-35 model since the original engines made for the SU-57 ended up being to big so the SU-57 may not be able to Supercruise in full combat load.

### Minor Operational Advantage over F-22 Raptor
Unlike the F-22 Raptor, the SU-57 Felon supports [[Mid-Air Refueling\|Mid-Air Refueling]] and has a thermal IR support built in its nose which allows it to use Thermal Weapons like [[IR Guided Missiles (Fox-2)\|IR Guided Missiles (Fox-2)]] and [[RADAR-based Missiles (Fox-3)\|RADAR-based Missiles (Fox-3)]] with greater accuracy.

### Future Upgrades
This offset in firepower against the F-22 is handled by the additional drones the SU-57 comes with. Yes there are jammer-bomber drones that resemble a miniature version of [[Northrop B-2 Bomber\|Northrop B-2 Bomber]] that is included in the price of the jet. These drones can communicate with AWACS, SU-57, and other fighters to make the SU-57 completely invisible. Being similar to B-2 in shape and having RAM coating all over the drone means that these are pretty stealthy themselves and will pose a massive challenge.

While the SU-57 is Russia's answer to the F-22 Raptor, The Russians are currently building the [[Sukhoi SU-75 Checkmate\|Sukhoi SU-75 Checkmate]] as the competitor of the [[Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning-II\|Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning-II]].
