# Learning Sanskrit
> A note which details the sources I use to learn Sanskrit. I am not sure how I will track progress here. Anyway! I am at least giving it my best shot.

Sanskrit is a language that I was fascinated by after I started to learn more about the language how it sounds so dignified & refined without even trying.
I believe that if Israel can revive Hebrew, then Indians should also revive Sanskrit so that we can have the Belgian model of two National Languages: Sanskrit & Tamil.

## Learning Resources
1. संस्कृत स्वयं शिक्षक - Satavlekar
	1. It has multiple chapters
	2. Teaches you Sanskrit by talking
2. Telegram Group
	1. Run by a kid named Prajwal, a Sanskrit Student from South India.
	2. He has Voice Chat where everyone converses only in Sanskrit. Helpful.
	3. His YouTube channel teaches Sanskrit like you would teach a little kid. Starting from "I am", "You are" etc.

## Scriptural Wisdom Sources
1. ==Nityānanda Miśra== - Not to be confused with the fugitive. He is a शिष्य of जगतगुरु श्री रामभद्राचर्य जी
2. ==Veducation YouTube Channel== - A devotee of ISKCON. Does great job explaining the tiniest details about the scriptures...
