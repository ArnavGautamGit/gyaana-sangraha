# Decentralised Crypto Exchange
> It is a type of marketplace hosted on the [[Decentralised Network\|Decentralised Network]] where you can trade [[Cryptocurrency\|Cryptocurrency]] for real money or trade one cryptocurrency for another of equal value.

It is important to be noted that these are better than Centralised Crypto Exchanges like Uphold, WazirX and Vauld. Decentralised ones do not generally hold your keys & you can trade Crypto Coins freely despite any of the cryptocurrencies being banned in one country or the other.

### No KYC required
These exchanges have no KYC requirement, they will not collect your government IDs and they will not end up harming your [[Personal Online Privacy\|Personal Online Privacy]].

### Your Funds are Yours Alone
Unlike Centralised Crypto Exchanges like Uphold, you do not need to transfer your funds to the exchange, you deal directly from your Crypto Wallet (which is hopefully [[Non-Custodian Wallet\|Non-Custodial]]).
