# Daggerheart
> A [[Table-Top Role-Playing Game\|Table-Top Role-Playing Game]] made & backed by [[Critical Role\|Critical Role]]. It is releasing in Spring 2025 but it is already out in Open Beta in 2024.

It is similar to [[Dungeons & Dragons\|D&D]] but not the same. It uses 2d12 instead of 1d20. I am also planning to create my own [[DaggerSoul Project\|Daggerheart Bot]] named "DaggerSoul" but first I need a bot that can ping it all the time.

#### Mechanics
In Daggerheart, a pair of d12 dice are used - known as the [[Duality Dice\|Duality Dice]].
The Character Creation Process is described in [[DH Character Creation\|DH Character Creation]].
If you want to Multi-class, check the [[DH Multiclassing Rules\|DH Multiclassing Rules]]
The Combat is decribed in [[DH Combat Rules\|DH Combat Rules]].
There are specific rules for Character Death in [[DH Character Death Rules\|DH Character Death Rules]].
There are also no shortage of mechanics for [[DH Character Rest Rules\|DH Character Rest Rules]].

Checking if an attack hits or not is checked via the 2d12 [[Duality Dice\|Duality Dice]] instead of the classic d20, there are other concepts like [[Hit Point Slots\|Hit Point Slots]] which are fixed for each character (unless increased by taking a specific Class or Foundation) while the characters can spend or mark off [[Armour Slots\|Armour Slots]] to avoid taking damage to their Hit Points and possibly dying. 

Advantage and Disadvantage is marked using a d6 dice along with the 2d12, if the player has an Advantage on a roll, add the d6 value. If the player has Disadvantage, subtract the d6 value.

1x [[Hope Token\|Hope Token]] can be spent by any character to give another character apart from themselves an advantage on their rolls. 
Whereas any pair of characters can choose to strike off 3x [[Hope Token\|Hope Token]] each to team up & attack together at the same time.
