# Philosophies in International Studies
> There are many philosophical viewpoints that exist in International Studies but there are 3 major ones that we shall study in the course: [[Idealism\|Idealism]], [[Realism\|Realism]] and [[Neo-Realism\|Neo-Realism]].

Note: These Philosophies are not exclusive to International Relations or International Studies, they are just popularly used in the field.
### Where are these Philosophies utilised?
- These Philosophies (In International Studies) are utilised in describing and framing relations between [[State (United Nations)\|Member States]].
- The Philosophy among these which the State-in-question subscribes to often describes how the State-in-question behaves with other States and how they choose and run their alliances with other States.
- These Philosophies (once it is understood which state acts in accordance to which philosophy) also help the students of International Studies, Political Analysts, other states and Intelligence Agencies identify how the state-in-question may react to new information and developments in the world - effectively acting as personality tests for their (the state's) foreign policy.
- Although no state permanently sits in one Philosophy and neither does any state perfectly fit the mould for one Philosophy.
- It is also to be noted that the Philosophies listed here have developed chronologically, not all states deem the "latest model" as the best one. Example: Japan & India are still [[Idealism\|Idealistic]] states to a great degree whereas the USA is a [[Realism\|Realist]] State. Barely any state in the modern sense fully embraces [[Neo-Realism\|Neo-Realism]].
