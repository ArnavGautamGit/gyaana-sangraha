# P-Box
> Also called "Permutation Box", it is a mechanism used to deterministically shuffle the bits to transpose/permute them and obscuring the relationship between Ciphertext and Original Plaintext.

They are implemented in the form which is similar to miniaturised Log Tables just the same as the [[S-Box\|S-Box]].

There are three kinds of P-Boxes:
1. [[Compression P-Box\|Compression P-Box]]: Reduces the number of output bits.
2. [[Expansion P-Box\|Expansion P-Box]]: Increases the number of output bits.
3. [[Straight P-Box\|Straight P-Box]]: Same number of output bits as input bits.
