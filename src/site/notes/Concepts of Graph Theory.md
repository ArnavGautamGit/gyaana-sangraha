# Concepts of Graph Theory
> Subject I studied in 6th Semester of my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science Engineering from Jaypee Institute of Information Technology (JIIT), Noida.

The subject was taught by Professor Shruti Gupta - who (we guess) is the wife of Ashish sir (who taught us [[Software Engineering\|Software Engineering]] in the same semester). Her teaching style is great and she is interactive, she wants all the students to be involved and study well which is a great touch which complements her great teaching style very well. 

She makes students feel like they are seen & she expects all her students to do well - it is one of the reasons I worked hard since I wanted to live up to her expectations. Unfortunately due to pressure from other demanding subjects, I was unable to properly finish these notes and properly structure them topic wise. The following notes are structured lecture wise or broad topic wise and they are not atomic - like other notes.
