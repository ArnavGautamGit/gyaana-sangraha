# Pain Before Gain Fallacy
Special Flavour of [[Confirmation Bias\|Confirmation Bias]] which hinges on the the super age-old saying of "No Pain, No Gain" where if the siatuation is woresning than it is "going as per prediction" and if it gets better the expert attributes it to his prowess & the customer is happy.

Either way the "Expert" wins.

This is the fallacy which runs Christianity.
> "Its literal followers believe that before we can experience heaven on Earth, the world (as we know it) must be destroyed. Disasters, floods, fires and death - they are all part of the larger plan and ,ust take place. Believers will view any deterioration of improvement as [[Confirmation Bias\|Confirming Evidence]] and any improvement as a gift from God."

> ~ Chapter 12, (Page Number 40) from the book [[The Art of Thinking Clearly\|The Art of Thinking Clearly]]

Some bad Doctors use the phrase "it will get worse before it gets better" to hide their incompetence & use this fallacy as a shelter against possible criticism since they know that after some time the patient's health will get better due to the immune system eventually winning or the patient is gonna die... There are no enquiries set up on Doctors due to deaths on these matters and there is one less patient to bad mouth them. It is a perfect win-win for them.
