# Personal Online Privacy
> Personal Privacy is one of the important things in life giving you the choice of how much data you want to share about yourself with the other party. Often on the internet, the other party represents all the advertising companies trying to sell you ads...

Personal Online Privacy becomes an important thing if you do not want to be bombarded with ads all the damn time. Having better privacy can also protect you against scams since there is less info about you online while hackers would want to pick the easiest fish in the sea. In the shortest way possible, Privacy gives you the ability to say "none of your business" to advertisement companies online.

## First Step to Privacy - Compartmentalisation
Try to spearate your public, work and prvate life into 3 separate compartments. While public life can intersect with work life and vice-versa... keep your private life completely separate from the public & work lives. Do not give personal email to work colleagues. Do not use one email for all accounts. Do not give your phone number everywhere.

Now we need to make a private email address that only your close loved ones like immediate family members and close friends that you trust. only give that email to those people. no one else. This private email must not have any social media attached, should not have your real name and must have end-to-end encryption. Both Proton Mail and Tutanota is good for that usecase.

Spread awareness about Privacy but do not try to convince colleagues to use a more private messenger or whatever at first (unless they are close and you want to help them). Only use it with those that are close to you unless the colleagues are also on Signal but even then, do not talk about personal life with professional contacts.

## Second Step to Privacy - Leave most Social Media
Meta/Facebook takes a lot of your data and all of instagram, facebook, threads and even whatsapp is better to be avoided. Metadata Volume on WhatsApp is so high that encryption does not matter... CIA has admitted to killing people based on metadata like location of message sent, date, time etc of the message.

X/Twitter also has notoriously bad privacy, it showcases your country and your method of connection (Play Store, App Store or Web) i.e., they collect location data at all times and broadcast your country and Mobile OS at all times. Before leaving X/Twitter it is advised to please see: [[How to wipe all your tweets from Twitter\|How to wipe all your tweets from Twitter]].

## Third Step to Privacy - Encrypt Everything & use 2FA
For Private Communication with close friends and family, use Signal instead of WhatsApp because on Signal your [[End-to-End Encryption\|End-to-End Encryption]] actually works, Signal has additional layers of protection against metadata leakage and you will not get unsolicited messages from various companies trying to sell you their shitty products.

Good Encryption makes it impossible for middlemen like ad companies or messenger itself to listen to your conversation and use that. You must use a password manager like Bitwarden or 1Password alongside a 2FA authenticator app like EnteAuth for 2FA (do not give your phone number for 2FA unless it is a govt website). Some like Bitwarden offer this in their apps itself so it is up to you if you want to go for those same app options.

If you want to return to Social Media, you do so with new accounts that use a burner email made using temporary mail (hide my email on iPhone is a great feature). It must not use your real phone number - use [[VoIP Numbers\|VoIP Numbers]] freely here. Preferably also with a trusted VPN.

## Fourth Step to Privacy - Choosing a VPN & Browser
[[Virtual Private Network (VPN)\|Virtual Private Network (VPN)]] is one of the best things to protect your privacy along with using a privacy-first browser like Brave, DuckDuckGo or [[The Onion Router (TOR)\|The Onion Router (TOR)]] for browsing the web and your default search engine should also not be Google. Try Brave Search or something similar. 

Keep in mind that most TOR browsers are not truely private on iPhone so you can avoid them. Additionally you should only trust Mullvad VPN and Proton VPN for best privacy. Keep your browsers, emails and VPNs from different companies.

> [!warning] Segregate your eggs into different baskets!
> Avoid Proton VPN if you used Proton Mail in Step 1 for private encrypted email (since it gives Proton a lot of data about you that they will be forced to provide to any govt if they are subjected to [[Subpeona Requests\|Subpeona Requests]] by said govt)

## Fifth Step to Privacy - Financial Privacy
Now that you have that down, we need to research how you can protect yourselves against advertisement companies and governments around the globe from seeing your credit score, bank balance, transactions and sell you ads based on that!

It is simple actually... whenever in person do not use UPI or digital transaction, prefer to use cash for basic stuff, for more "visible" stuff you can use online payments (like EMIs, Home Loan etc) while for regula things like cabs and stuff you can use cash although using public transit & recharging your transit card with cash is a better deal.

For absolute digital privacy in transactions, if you are outside north america and cannot use services like Privacy.com then I only have the option of suggesting Privacy-oriented [[Cryptocurrency\|Cryptocurrency]] like [[Monero (XMR)\|Monero (XMR)]] and [[ZCash (ZEC)\|ZCash (ZEC)]]. You can purchase them from any [[Decentralised Crypto Exchange\|Decentralised Crypto Exchange]] and transfer them into any [[Non-Custodian Wallet\|Non-Custodian Wallet]].

## Sixth Step to Privacy - Delete existing info
You can delete existing info about you using services like DeleteMe and even use different accounts on different devices to subscribe & follow different things so yo eventually can diffuse that data about yourself (but it is easier to just get the info deleted)

## Final Step to Privacy - Support the services that make Privacy Possible!
Support Free & Open Source Apps that do not harvest data. Support the services that make privacy possible and that you regularly use! Support them with downloads, active use and a small donation of $1 from time to time...

## Extra Tips & Tricks
- When in public, ordering from a restaurant or coffee place do not use your real name that will be shouted around the entire place. It is not helpful in anyway.
- Do not give your govt ID to any social media for storage - that is the fastest way it gets leaked in the next leak.
- Do not use your real name on Uber and such apps. Use nicknames or use only your first name (since full names are not required in most places). Some people go a bit extreme and use fake names when calling cabs or ordering stuff online.
- If you feel unsafe with Android or iPhone, try to get your hands on a Google Pixel and move to something like GrapheneOS for Privacy.
- If you feel threatened enough, you can use Veracrypt or something other than the deault disc encryption on Windows (because they have the keys or their copies).
