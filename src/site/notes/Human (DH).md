# Human (DH)
> Humans are... well humans! They are a common feature in every RPG and [[Daggerheart\|Daggerheart]] is no different where Humans are included as a [[DH Species Ancestry\|DH Species Ancestry]].

Humans height in-game ranges from 5 to 6 feet - however humans can be shorter. If you want to recreate yourself and you are shorter, try taking [[Dwarf (DH)\|Dwarf (DH)]] or [[Halfling (DH)\|Halfling (DH)]] which are basically special cases of Human DNA...

On taking the Human Ancestry, you gain the following Ancestry Features:
- ***High Stamina***: Take an extra [[Stress Point\|Stress Point]] at character creation.
- ***Adaptability***: When you fail a roll that used one of your experiences, you can reroll by simply marking 1x [[Stress Point\|Stress Point]] (must take new roll).

In-game mechanics make it so that Humans live approximately 100 years on average.
