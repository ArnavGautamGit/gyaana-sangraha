# Warframe: Everything about the 2013 game!
Warframe came out in 2013 and is still going strong with a growing community and lore around it.
It is name after the Warframes - the suits of armour worn by the in-game protagonists (Finish 'The Second Dream' Quest for a quick & awesome plot twist!)

The game relies on Modding heavily.
Modding is the process of adding mods to the stock equipment to make it perform better.
Anything in the game can be modded from pets to guns to vehicles!
It is important to note that "mods" in Warframe do NOT carry the same connotation in Warframe as they do outside of it. ("Modding" in a game is generally associated with hacking it but in Warframe it is the name of in-game items that can help improving its attributes)

## Modding the Warframes
When Modding the Warframes in the game, it is important to note that we are modding for the following things:
1. ***==Survivability==***: Increasing the Ability of the Warframe to survive the mission it is inside. On lower levels, it is not something that isn't fixable for example, it is easily done by slapping on Vitality and Redirection (names of two mods increasing health and shields respectively). At higher levels you will have to chose one of the three sides:
	- **==Tanking==**: Naturally suited to Warframes such as Inaros and Hildryn due to high health and high shields respectively (Inaros has no shields at all)
		- ***How to identify a Tank?*** Its easy! All you need to do is to check their stats if they have high base health/shields with an ability or two about Damage Reduction and you have a tank! Tanks also have high armour.
		- ***How to mod this tank?*** If they are a High Health tank , then Vitality, Ability Strength for their Damage Reduction ability. For a High Shield tank, use Redirection and Ability Strengthening mods. If you have unlocked Arcanes and Archon Shards... then by all means go ahead and use them too.
	- **==Abilities==**: Naturally suited to Warframes that survive by using their Abilities. Furhter divided into two categories:
		- ***Energy Drainers***: These Warframes have abilities that do not cost much to cast but drain energy per second to keep the ability up and running. Example: Excalibur and Exhaulted Blade! Mod them by modding their **Energy Duration**!
		- ***Energy Casters***: Warframes that only have to see the upfront cost of casting abilities and do not have abilities that cost a per-second drain to keep them up and running. Improve Survivability by modding their **Energy Maxium** and **Energy Efficiency**.
	- **==Shield Gating==**: Naturally suited to Warframes that have either Low Shields or those that have high shields with an Ability that can suddenly boost their shields to maximum in a very short span of time. Any Warframe can fit into category one (by removing Redirection Mod) but a very few actually fit in category two (like Harrow and his 'Condemn' ability). ***Remember that Shield Gating is going to be reworked!***
2. ***==Energy Regeneration==*** : Increasing the Warframe's ability to regenerate Energy to cast the very abilities Warframes need to be set apart! ***Choose according to your Warframe of choice*** (is it an Energy Drainer or Energy Caster) ***and your playstyle*** (do you want your Warframe's abilities more upfront damage or you want them to last longer and do damage by stacking status effect and Critical Multipliers?)
