# Inferis (DH)
> A [[DH Species Ancestry\|DH Species Ancestry]] of humanoids with sharp canines, pointed ears and horns coming in various styles. Horns are mostly symmetric and even-numbered but any amount of horns (maximum 5-6) are allowed. The horns may even reconnect to form one singular looped horn. Some Inferis may be born with or without tails which may or may not be forked. It is important to note that the number and nature of the horns and tail(s) is hereditary.
> Creativity of the player is the limit to all the character creation possibilities presented here.

Inferis are famous for carving, shaping, decorating and even reinforcing their horns just like how [[Galapa (DH)\|Galapa (DH)]] are famous to do the same for their shells. Inferis are also known for having a height between 4 to 7 feet tall. Also, this ancestry was previously called "Daemon" and seems to be a import of [[Tiefling (D&D)\|Tiefling (D&D)]].

On taking Inferis, you gain the following Ancestry Features:
- ***Fearless***: Mark 2x [[Stress Point\|Stress Point]] to turn a Roll with Fear into a Roll with Hope.
