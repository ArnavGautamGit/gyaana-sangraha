# Ping-Pong Diplomacy
> The use of Table Tennis (also called "Ping-Pong") for [[Diplomacy\|Diplomacy]] between United States of America and [[Communist China\|Communist China]].

Now the term has become synonymous with "Sports Diplomacy" which uses sports prowess to extend a diplomatic hand. Originally the term was about the USA team being invited by China to play a few exhibition matches in Shanghai, Tanjin and other Chinese Cities in April of 1971.

The trip included an exchange of culture where the US team watched many cultural dance shows, received cultural gifts. The Chinese Table Tennis Team was always considered way better than others but at the time in 1971, they had the best Table Tennis Team on the planet - even today they frequently reach many world finals.

Sports is often used as a matter of diplomacy by [[State (United Nations)\|States]] that wish to leverage it to form diplomatic relations or strengthen them. It generaly involves a better team inviting a slightly worse but competitive team to their home ground & via the match telecast, news telecast & cameras following the teams showcase their culture to the invited state in an attempt of cultural exchange.
