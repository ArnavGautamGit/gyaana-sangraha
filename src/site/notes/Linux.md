# Linux
> Free & Open-Source [[OS Kernel\|OS Kernel]] based on UNIX made by Linus Torvalds in 1991 which spawned a close family of [[Operating System\|Operating Systems]] all using the same Linux Kernel where each member is called a "Distribution".

Linux seems to be named as an combination of Linus and UNIX - the two creators of the OS. Eventually many distributions of Linux have reached the Market starting from [[Arch Linux\|Arch Linux]], [[Debian Linux\|Debian Linux]] all the way to newer ones like [[NixOS\|NixOS]].

### Legacy & Importance
Linux is arguably the biggest open-source project that has inspired every single other [[Free & Open Source Software (FOSS)\|FOSS]] Project ever since. Due to being FOSS, it has captured and dominated the Server Space and Linux is considered the literal best OS for any server.

Using the Linux Kernel for your own [[Operating System\|Operating System]] is free and allowed but in the terms it clearly states that the resulting Operating System needs to be FOSS as well. This is why the original [[Android OS\|Android OS]] Project (AOSP) is still open-source since that is also based on Linux.

Due to above reasons, it is safe to say that Linux has become the basis and foundation of Computing as a whole - it is lighter on the hardware, does not force the user to update their device and is heavily optimised.

### Distributions
All Operating Systems that use the same Linux Kernel are referred to as Linux Distributions since they use esentially the same "backend" for their OS needs. Most Linux Distributions are based on one of the older "parent" distributions (most common of them being [[Debian Linux\|Debian Linux]]) and it is best to learn these earlier distributions to understand the basics of Linux as a whole.
