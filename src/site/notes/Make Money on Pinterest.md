# Make Money on Pinterest
> A guide on how to make money from Pinterest and actually make a side-hustle.

Steps for success are given below:
1. Make your own blog
	1. Find a topic with a list of your interests & applying the supply-demand analysis on each listed item to find the best one.
	2. Get a domain
	3. Build a website (again)
2. Learn how to get traffic to your Pinterest Account
	1. Pinterest is not a Social Media but a search engine where people look for answers, inspirations or guides.
	2. Give solutions or guides on things that you are passionate about (see point 1.1 above)
	3. Use your writing skill to skillfully squeeze in an affiliate or sponsor link.
3. It won't be an overnight success but keep going at it. You'll get it some time & your day shall come one day (hopefully).

Even if you can pull $50 to $150 USD it is AWESOME!
You just need to scale.
