# Sātavāhana Empire
> An empire in Central India which came to rise after the fall of the [[Mauryan Empire\|Mauryan Empire]]. It reached its maximum size and wealth under [[Gautamiputra Satakarni\|Gautamiputra Satakarni]].

The name "Sātavāhana" seems to mean "7 vehicles" in Sanskrit & Hindi and probably refers to "driven by 7" or "7 horses" all of which refers to how the Hindu God of the Sun, [[Sūrya (सूर्य)\|Sūrya (सूर्य)]] seems to have 7 horses pulling his chariot - where each horse represents one colour of the Spectrum of Light. The reason to have an association is probably to claim lineage from a dynasty which has produced warriors like [[Lord Rāma\|Lord Rāma]] and can assert a "divine right to rule".

They issued their own [[Kārṣāpaṇa Coins\|Kārṣāpaṇa Coins]] made of Lead & Potin.
***They were also at consistent war with the [[Western Kshatrapa\|Western Kshatrapa]]*** while the [[Northern Kshatrapa\|Northern Kshatrapa]] became a vassal of & merged with the [[Kushan Empire\|Kushan Empire]] - so Satvahanas could not fight them.

The popular king named "Shalivahana" in Hindu, Jain and Buddhist Literature seems to be based on a Satvahana king.
