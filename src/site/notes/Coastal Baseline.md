# Coastal Baseline
> Normally defined as the low-water lines along the coast as marked on Large Scale Charts which are recognised by the Coastal [[State (United Nations)\|Member State]].

Other Legal ways that States define Baseline is counted either from: 
(a) the low-water mark closest to the shore or 
(b) the furthest extent of land exposed during low-tides but covered in the high tides and this land has to be within 3 Nautical Miles from permanently exposed land.

In case of an Archipalegic [[State (United Nations)\|Member State]], the islands that fall within the Jurisdiction of the State can be connected by Straight Baselines. The same rules apply in the case of Baselines across a [[River Delta\|River Delta]] or the mouth of a [[Bay\|Bay]].
