# Roots of Racism in Christianity
According to [[Nelson Maldonaldo-Torres\|Nelson Maldonaldo-Torres]]'s interpretation of Columbus's letters to-and-fro from Central America and Europe,

When Christopher Columbus arrived in Central America he was confused where to place the native americans (who he called "Indians" & hence also called "Red Indians") since Christianity only acknowledges three categories: Christians, Infidels and Idolators.

Columbus hence assumed that these Native Americans were not a people with a 'different' or 'wrong' or 'false' religion - rather they were people without any religion.

In Christianity, absence of religion is considered as an absence of soul with a soul being the entity needed to communicate and connect with the divine [[God in Christianity\|Christian God]] and hence these natives since they were without souls could be mercilessly murdered, raped, pillaged and burned since it is their lack of souls which makes them worship nature over God who created nature.
This distinction between those with a soul and those without is basically what created the racial divide according to Torres.

What followed has been covered in [[European Destruction of the Native Americas\|European Destruction of the Native Americas]] and the process is explained in [[European Method of Colonisation\|European Method of Colonisation]]
