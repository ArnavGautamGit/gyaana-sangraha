# Hypervisor
> Software that cna facilitate [[Virtualisation\|Virtualisation]] by making the hardware available and partioned to be used by multiple [[Operating System\|Operating Systems]] while each partial resource remains segregated. 

If the Hypervisor assigns one core to each OS, then the OS are limited to their own core and their own specific blocks of memory they are assigned. There is no sharing of resources among any [[Virtual Machine\|Virtual Machine]] that runs on any PC.

In 2006, a malware named Blue Pill was discovered which could facilitate this sharing of resources and violating the privacy of the users. It can intercept communication between Guest and Host Machines in a [[Virtual Machine\|Virtual Machine]] environment.
