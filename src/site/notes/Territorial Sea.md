# Territorial Sea
> The part of the any Large Water Body within a maximum of 12 Nautical Miles from the [[Coastal Baseline\|Coastal Baseline]] of any Coastal [[State (United Nations)\|Member State]] is considered as the Territorial Sea of that state. If a state claims less than 12 Nautical Miles as their Territorial Sea, then they can claim a larger [[Contiguous Maritime Zone (CMZ)\|Contiguous Maritime Zone (CMZ)]]. Similarly the Contiguous Zone may be narrower if another member's CMZ overlaps with it. 

In case there is an overlap between two countries on their Territorial Sea, the median point between two states's [[Coastal Baseline\|Coastal Baseline]] must be taken unless the States agree otherwise via a Bilateral Treaty. This process of limiting the Territorial Sea due to overlaps is referred to as Maritime Delimitation.
