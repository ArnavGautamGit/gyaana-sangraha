# China's Silent Espionage
> Note that discusses China's Espionage Tactics and uncovers  who their Espionage tactics stay silent & off the Radar so easily.

Via [[Books Library/The Unending Game\|The Unending Game]], Former Secretary of [[R&AW\|R&AW]], Mr. [[Vikram Sood\|Vikram Sood]] claim that China, Russia and the USA will be the major forces in the Espionage world & I am not going to try to counter the claim. On the contrary, I will try to find out his reasons on why he may think that way using Mr. Sood's own writings taken from the same book about how Chinese Espionage works.

### Utilisation of Tourists & Immigrants as Spies
On 27th of March 1999 during the Kosovo War, a Serbian Missile shot down an [[F-117 Nighthawk\|F-117 Nighthawk]] - one of the first to reach the crash site were Chinese tourists and immigrants bringing debris by buying whatever parts they found from local farmers. In 2011, China unveiled the pictures of a prototype version of the [[Chengdu J-20\|Chengdu J-20]] which looked suspiciously similar and that too mere days before the U.S Secretary of Defence was to land in Beijing. All the cry about Chinese Tourists being trapped in the Warzone was all bogus propaganda.

### The Mao Effect
Mao wanted internal consolidation and breaking the espionage rings of the foreign states and he never considered sending spies abroad. The main interest for the [[Chinese Communist Party (CCP)\|Chinese Communist Party (CCP)]] at that time was to keep influences from Taiwan, India, Japan and Korea out of the Chinese Homeland. It is interesting to note that as mentioned by Mr. Sood on Page 74 of [[Books Library/The Unending Game\|The Unending Game]], apparently Chinese considered India as a lackey of the West.

The Chinese then planned for teaching Indians a lesson at the McMahon Line.
Mr. Sood describes those days in China as "complete politicisation" of Intelligence during the frequent purges of many ethnicities in China including Tibetans during the [[Big Leap Forward (BLF)\|Big Leap Forward (BLF)]] and the [[Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution\|Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution]].

### Lessons from the West
Deng Xiaopeng's economic reforms of 1978 changed the course of the Chinese Intelligence efforts. Now the Chinese wanted to send spies into the Western World to see how these economics grow so they could carve out a path of their own economic growth.

The Chinese were alarmed by the backwardness of their systems when it saw the weapons used by the USA in [[The U.S-Iraq War (1990)\|The U.S-Iraq War (1990)]] and then [[The Dissolution of Yugoslavia\|The Dissolution of Yugoslavia]] they started moving their Intelligence Apparatus in new directions.

### Cyber Attacks to siphon away research
On eof the new directions where the Chinese Intelligence moved was to somehow siphon off and reverse engineer blueprints and parts found/stolen of denied technologies developed around the world.

The U.S leads the Military Innovation of the world with the big fat Defence Budget. It is obvious that the Chinese targeted them first.

Purists would distinguish between theft and Intelligence collection but the Chinese see this as one of their high points to be able to steal technology from a country like the U.S where Cyber Security (until recently) only has value on paper unlike Europe where Security is seen as one of the Paramount Subjects.

The transcript of the U.S Congressional Hearing on 9th of June 2016 ([[China's Silent Espionage#^1\|#^1]]) stated that in 2009 Chinese hackers were able to steal data from Boeing's servers containing documents connected with [[Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor\|Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor]] and [[Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning-II\|Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning-II]].

### Tactics used by Chinese Intelligence
Chinese Intelligence Agency the [[Mininstry of State Security (MSS)\|Mininstry of State Security (MSS)]] manages several think tanks in China to control the public opinion. The Presidient of the think tank [[China Institute of International Strategic Studies\|China Institute of International Strategic Studies]] has always been a crucial man in Chinese Military Intelligence.

Chinese MSS often uses Research Institutes as bases of clandestine operations. At home, Chinese MSS officers do not hide their identity & routinely raid brothels, bars, shops and any other business owned by ethnically Taiwanese businessman to blackmail them to spy for them.

Sometimes, the Chinese Intelligence sends people through Diplomatic Visa as a part of the Embassy. Then, these officers are allowed to resign and stay in the target [[State (United Nations)\|state]] to gain legitimacy in areas like U.S and Canada.

The Chinese are also notorious for using Women to entice & ensnare targets for blackmail and intelligence. The MSS agent, Katrina Leung was inducted by the FBI as a mole but the woman ended up using two FBI agents from 1982 to 2003 & obtained classified intel from them. 
Chinese MSS also trapped a high level Indian Diplomat in Beijing some years ago.

Thousand Grains Principle: Chinese emmigrants share all knowledge whether gossip, rumour or fact to their family since they are a collective society and all MSS has to do is to maintain a close but clandestine presence with the family of the emmigrant to know what all is happening.

### Comparison with Indian Intelligence Network
Nicholas Groffmann, who practices Law in Beijing & Shanghai in one of his articles titled "Indian and Chinese Covert Efforts" & was also quoted in The Unending Game.

He says that the Chinese Intelligence Network produces a lot of intelligence which is either useless or the useful part is ignored. Whereas, Indian Intelligence Network is much smaller but a small chunk of exceptional officers do the bulk of useful work who justify the budget of the entire network. According to him the Chinese seem to uninterested in India beyond knowing the Indian Military's Order of Battle which is common knowledge in military circles nowadays.

He mentions that the Dalai Lama and Tibetans are major areas of interest for the Chinese along with Arunachal Pradesh.

It is important to note that since Mr. Groffmann practices in China (Beijing & Shanghai) hence he might be intentionally underselling the Chinese MSS so that they are not seen as much of a threat and any potential targets of Intelligence are taken by surprise. A classic sandbagging strategy.

Anyway, we know that: 
a) There are hardly any people in China of Indian Ethnicity i.e., no non-diplomatic cover is available.
b) China has extensive Cyber Security and [[Cyber Warfare\|Cyber Warfare]] capabilities when compared to India.
c) Chinese have ensured that Indians have no access to Tibetans

Infact if the University of Toronto's 2009 "Ghostnet" report is to be trusted, China has breached networks of India's Informatics Centre, Ministry of External Affairs, several Indian Embassies & the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre which already means that China IS INTERESTED in India and Mr. Nicholas Groffmann is atleast partially incorrect.

### Steps that India should take
India will have to improve on the Cyber Security side of things while also equipping [[R&AW\|R&AW]] with the latest of Tech. India will also have to find a way to raise [[Human Intelligence (HUMINT)\|Human Intelligence (HUMINT)]] sources in China regardless of Indian Ethnic Presence in the [[State (United Nations)\|state]].
