# D&D d20 Tests
> A d20 Test is any roll in [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/D&D Compendium/Dungeons & Dragons\|Dungeons & Dragons]] which would require you to roll a D20 Dice and add modifiers to it. The resultant of the roll is used to determine success or failure of the Action is uncertain.

D20 Tests come in three flavours: Ability Checks, Saving Throws and Attack Rolls.
Each Test requires the players to firstly roll a 1d20, then add any modifiers.
This combined total is then compared to a [[Difficulty Class (DC)\|Difficulty Class (DC)]] to find if Success is achieved.

### Ability Checks
Using Talent and Training to overcome a challenge i.e., a check to determine whether the Player Character (PC) has enough ability to perform a task.

Ability Checks use the Ability Stats of the Character in Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom or Charisma. Ability Modifier is added to the d20 roll.

Some may use skills such as "Athletics" or "Acrobatics" among others that are linked to each of these checks. These are called Skill Checks. Skill Modifiers are added to the d20 roll.

### Saving Throws
Also known as "save" is a maneuver made by any creature/group to save themselves in an event of an attack or any potential damage coming their way. In effect, the creature does not choose to make a saving throw at all. It is a necessity that they have to make one. 

Some abilities may require a saving throw from a target, if the players determine that they need to fail a saving throw for something beneficial, they may choose to fail said saving throw and avoid rolling.

Certain Saving throws made against an opponent's Attack Roll utilise [[Armour Class (AC)\|Armour Class (AC)]] of the target as the [[Difficulty Class (DC)\|DC]] to check whether the target is able to make the save or fails. On a fail, target takes damage

### Attack Rolls
An attack roll determines whether an attack hits a target. An attack roll hits if the roll equals or ex ceeds the target's [[Armour Class (AC)\|Armour Class (AC)]]. The Ability Modifiers are used depending upon the weapon.

| Ability   | Attack Type                                                              |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Strength  | Unarmed Strike or Melee Weapon                                           |
| Dexterity | Ranged Attack with Weapon                                                |
| Varies    | Spell Attack <br>(Wizards use Intelligence, Sorcerers use Charisma etc.) |

The Nature of the weapon is used to determine which ability will be used and then a check is made to see if it hits. If a melee weapon is used as a thrown weapon, it will still take Dexterity trait.

### Advantage & Disadvantage
If ***Advantage***, players roll their 1d20 dice twice and pick the ***HIGHER*** of the two results.
If ***Disadvantage***, players roll their 1d20 dice twice and pick the ***LOWER*** of the two results.

Neither Advantage nor Disadvantage stacks with the number of effects granting advantage or disadvantage. They do however cancel each other out.
