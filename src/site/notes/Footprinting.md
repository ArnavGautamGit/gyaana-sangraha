# Footprinting
> The Process of collecting prelimnary information about a target with the objective of understanding the target's weaknesses and assess how many & what kinds of Approaches would work best against the target.

In [[Penetration Testing\|Penetration Testing]] or [[Cyber Reconnaissance\|Cyber Reconnaissance]], "Approaches" may mean "Cyber Attacks" to use against the target i.e., it means that the Hacker-in-question needs to find maximum ways of intrusion or the attacks best suited for the same.

In the world of [[Intelligence (Espionage)\|Intelligence (Espionage)]],  an "Approach" refers to how the target must be handled - it is also explained in [[Types of HUMINT sources\|Types of HUMINT sources]]. The Tools used for this are explained in the [[Guide to Footprinting (Espionage)\|Guide to Footprinting (Espionage)]].

### Classification of Techniques
Footprinting can be passive or active depending upon how "active" the process is - i.e., if we are just searching for information from the internet vs actively using [[Footprinting#Tools of Cyber Footprinting\|#Tools of Cyber Footprinting]] on the target system/network. This is basically the same as we discussed [[Cyber Reconnaissance#Classification on the basis of Activity\|here]].

### Tools of Cyber Footprinting
1. [[Netcraft\|Netcraft]]
2. [[Shodan\|Shodan]]
3. [[BuiltWith\|BuiltWith]]
4. [[Wayback Machine\|Wayback Machine]]
5. [[Ping\|Ping]] and [[nsLookup\|nsLookup]]
6. [[Google Advanced Search\|Google Advanced Search]] and [[Web Spiders\|Web Spiders]]
7. [[Maltego\|Maltego]]
8. [[Recon-ng\|Recon-ng]]
9. [[Fingerprinting Organisations and Collected Archives (FOCA)\|Fingerprinting Organisations and Collected Archives (FOCA)]]

### Target Information to be Gathered
1. Domain Name
2. IP Address
3. Namespaces
4. Employee Information (using stuff like PeopleSmart, AnyWho, US Search etc.)
	1. Phone Number
	2. Emails etc.
5. Company Information
	1. Job Roles & Information. 
	2. Any New Hirings - useful for if the attacker wants to gain Inside Information without risk discovery, the attacker can use the job as a cover.
	3. Address & Location (latter by [[Using Google Earth as Spyware\|Using Google Earth as Spyware]]).
	4. Source Code & the Comments in it.
	5. Among others ([[Intercepting Email Headers\|Intercepting Email Headers]])

### Specific Techniques
1. [[Website Mirroring\|Website Mirroring]]
2. [[Footprinting via Social Engineering\|Footprinting via Social Engineering]]
3. [[Competitive Intelligence Gathering\|Competitive Intelligence Gathering]]
4. [[Whois\|Whois]] based Footprinting
5. [[DNS-based Footprinting\|DNS-based Footprinting]]
6. Network Footprinting using [[TraceRoute\|TraceRoute]]

### Countermeasures
1. Restrict access to Social Media from Company PCs
2. Configure Web Servers to avoid Information Leaks
3. Educate the employees to limit what they say online.
4. Educate the employees to use pseudonyms on blogs, websites, etc.
5. Educate the employees to not reveal critical information on press releases.
6. Educate the employees about the techniques and risks of [[Social Engineering\|Social Engineering]].
7. Use Footprinting Technique to find and destroy any sensitive information about you or your company online.
8. Encrypt and Password Protect Sensitive Information.
