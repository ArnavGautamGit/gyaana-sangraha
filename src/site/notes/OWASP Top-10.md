# OWASP Top-10
> List of Top-10 most critical [[Website Applications\|Web App]] [[Cyber Security Terminology#Vulnerabilities\|Vulnerabilities]] sorted by risk & how prominent these vulnerabilities are.

This list can be created by [[OWASP\|OWASP]], a non-profit organisation which has made a turstworthy name for itself in [[Cyber Security (CyberSec)\|Cyber Security]] and [[Software Engineering\|Software Engineering]]. Each vulnerability has a number like "A03-2021" and these are well understood enough that [[Vulnerability Scanning\|Vulnerability Scanning]] reports often cite these numbers.

### Trends & Importance
It is used a lot in the field and its word is taken seriously.
In 2021, [[Injection-based Attacks\|Injection-based Attacks]] went from 1st in 2017 to 3rd in 2021. Broken Access Control went from 5th to 1st. Meaning just being mentioned on OWASP resulted in Injection being patched into oblivion.
