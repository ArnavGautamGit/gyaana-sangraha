# Malicious Hacking
> [[Hacking\|Hacking]] (i.e., gaining unauthorised access into computing devices or user accounts or data on said devices which is owned or used by someone else) done with any malicious intent of causing harm to humans or property or to steal the money of the target person, group of persons or organisation.

This is what the regular folk guess when we ask them what their perception of hacking & hackers is. It is performed by [[Black-Hat Hackers\|Black-Hat Hackers]]. In short, Although Hacking is stereotyped to be Negative, it can also be used to help defend systems if performed [[Ethical Hacking\|Ethically]].

If this kind of behaviour on the Internet breaks any laws of the [[State (United Nations)\|State]] in which the target or targets reside, then it is technically called a [[Cyber Crime\|Cyber Crime]]. 
However, if it is targeted to a singular person or organisation whether the organisation is formally recognised or not, it will be considered a ***Cyber Attack*** regardless of if it has broken any laws or not.

## Classification into Various Types
#### Classification based on targets
Depending upon the target of the hack, we can classify the hack into types.
[[System Hacking\|System Hacking]] is a type where the main target of the hack is one or more isolated systems. If the target is a network or the systems are not mutually isolated, then it is known as [[Network Hacking\|Network Hacking]].

#### Classification based on attackers
Depending upon if it is a person from inside the organisation/team/family which was hit or outside, it is recognised as an Insider Attack or Outsider Attack respectively.

#### Classification based on methods
Depending upon whether the attack is done over the Internet or on a harware connected physically (like a Pendrive connected to the target) we can classify the attacks as [[Online Cyber Attack\|Online Cyber Attack]] and [[Offline Cyber Attack\|Offline Cyber Attack]].
