# USA-India Civil Nuclear Agreement
The US-India Civil Nuclear Agreement, also known as the 123 Agreement, was signed on October 10, 2008, between the United States and India. The agreement allows for civilian nuclear cooperation between the two countries, including the transfer of nuclear technology and fuel to India.

**Key Provisions:**
- The agreement recognizes India as a responsible nuclear power and allows it to engage in civilian nuclear trade with the US.
- India agrees to separate its civilian and military nuclear programs, with the [[International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)\|International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)]] verifying the civilian program.
- The US will provide India with nuclear fuel and technology for civilian use, while India will not be allowed to reprocess or enrich the fuel.
- The agreement does not require India to sign the Nuclear [[Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT)\|Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT)]] or the [[Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT)\|Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT)]].
- The agreement also allows for cooperation in the fields of space exploration, satellite navigation, and launch.

**Impact:**
- The agreement has been seen as a significant step forward in the US-India relationship, marking a shift from decades of tension and mistrust to a more cooperative partnership.
- The agreement has also been seen as a way to promote nuclear non-proliferation, as it recognizes India’s commitment to separating its civilian and military nuclear programs.
- However, some critics have raised concerns about the agreement’s potential to increase India’s ability to produce nuclear weapons, as it does not require India to sign or ratify the CTBT or the NPT.
