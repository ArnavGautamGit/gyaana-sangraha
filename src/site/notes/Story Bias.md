# Story Bias
>Tendency to connect two related or unrelated facts to form a story which is either an oversimplification or pure fiction. Sometimes the stories potray a limited view of what happened if they are ideological in nature.

Stories are important since the basis of stories is the underlying connection of ideas. Human Brain learns and retains things that have a reason, meaning or connection with things we already know. Sometimes Stories are a way to summarise what happened but there is a strong chance they get affected by [[Hindsight Bias\|Hindsight Bias]].

### Avoidance
Fight this Story Bias and all the YouTube Analysts by asking:
1. Who is the sender?
2. What are their intentions?
3. What did they hide under the rug?
