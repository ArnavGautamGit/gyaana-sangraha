# What is a Target Audience?
Every piece of media i.e., news, movie, video-games are made with a target audience in mind. The people the media is suppose to appeal to the most (or is trying to appeal to the most).
These people are called a Target Audience because the media is trying to target/prioritise them.
# How are Target Audiences Defined?
Target Audiences are defined using two metrics:
1. ***==Demography==***: Consumer is typed on the basis of age, religion, gender, nationality etc.
2. ==***Psychography***==: Consumer is types on the basis of music taste, political opinion, likes and dislikes among other such psychological factors.
# "Audience" as an Acronym
A ---> Analysis
U ---> Understanding
D ---> Demographic
 I  ---> Interest
E ---> Education or Expertise
N ---> Needs
C ---> Culture

# Audience Theories in Media
Theories of How Media can affect audiences and what ways can media be used to influence people. Also involves discussion on if these effects actually take place.
Although it can be applied to all media including journalism, it is not explicitly mentioned so to keep the notes in-line with the spirit of the academic literature it is a part of.
## Audience Theory 1: Hypodermic Needle
- Audience is a passive listener.
- Audience believes whatever is shown over and over.
- Propaganda is based on this theory.
- Not entirely true as evident in rise of Web 2.0 (where audience also started creating content in the form of content creators - on YouTube, Podcasts, Blogs etc.)
## Audience Theory 2: Two-step flow
- Still assumes the audience is passive.
- Opininon is shown over and over, while audience gets interested, & start following it.
- Media talks via an opinion leader {[[Audience Response Theories#^1\|#^1]]}. 
- The Facts are researched and everything by the Opinion Leader or the facts are given to them who present the facts in various ways to the Audience.
## Audience Theory 3: Uses & Gratification
- First to assume an active Audience.
- User wants to learn about something - could be anything the user wants to learn about.
- They go onto the internet to learn about it
- Satisfied & Gratified, they stop, else they keep going deeper.
- Reasons for search: 
	- Personal Identity
	- Entertainment {[[Audience Response Theories#^2\|#^2]]}
	- Information or Knowledge {[[Audience Response Theories#^3\|#^3]]}
## Audience Theory 4: Reception
- Audience is neither passive nor active.
- Audience interact with each other.
- Audience (on an individual level or whole level) negotiate, reject or accept what is shown
	- ***==Accepted/Preferred==***: View that the director wanted the audience to have.
	- ***==Negotiated==***: View the audience arrived at after weighing positives and negatives (preferred & oppositional views)
	- ***==Rejected/Oppositional==***: View of what the audience did not like or what was not intended by the director.
## Audience Theory 5: Effects Theory
- Theory of Effects state that whatever a person consumes, they tend to develop a similar tendency to do similar acts.
- If you indulge in Violent Movies and one watched violent movies in their formative years, they tend to turn violent.
- ### Questions on Media Violence:
	- It is widely known that constant, repeated viewing of Media Violence de-sensitizes viewers and cause them to not feel the pain... contributing to 'Mean World Syndrome'. 
	- But it leads us to question: is Media Violence influencing us and making people more violent - indirectly responsible for what is happening around the world or is thye media just depicting what is already happening around the globe?
	- Does Media cause Moral Panic {[[Audience Response Theories#^4\|#^4]]} or the Moral Panic is just a collective respose to collective insecurities of the society that the media brings to the surface?
- ### Studies done to prove the Effects Theory
	- There have been studies and some of them were discussed in the class. A study done on children to see if they get violent.... 
	- The kids were divided into 2 groups, each of them given a new toy. One group was shown the way to play with it is through being gentle and kind. Other group was shown that this is to be used like a punching bag of sorts...
	- The group that was shown to be gentle were a lot gentler than the group that was shown to be violent. The Violent group even took to using hammers and other such devices to harm the toy.
- ### My Criticism of the said "studies"
	- The Study only proves that we are violent in the short term after 1 exposure.
	- It does not track if the violent kids were shown the gentler video, will they still play the same way?
	- Neither does the study track if one exposure passes over this experience to other things in the kid's home/school.
	- The Study does not even take into account if the kids retain these traits after conscience and rationality develop as they grow or if the two aforementioned things (i.e., conscience and rationality) are affected by the said singular exposure/experience.
	- People do not become Chartered Accountants (CAs) because they played Monopoly when they were young.
- #### OPINION: Video Games do not cause Violence
	- The same aplies to those who say that Video-Games can cause violence or make kids more violent. If your kid is not able to differentiate between media violence and real life, its probably because you did not make it clear to them! If you think that a game is responsible for your kid's violent behaviour then its not the game but your upbringing.
	- Because even Dungeons & Dragons was deemed a "Satanist Board Game". it is just people who do not know much about Video-Games that comment on them.
# Reader Response Theories
Theories regarding how readers respond to the text they are given.
It is largely believed that any text is incomplete without the reader, since the reader gives it life and context. A reader of a different era, different geography and different culture will not find the same affinity with the text as the author since they are interpreting the text differently.

Any media that people can gain from, learn from for centuries or millenia after it was written is given the status of a classic. Any media (literature, film, music) that is considered a classic by a few only (since it was not understood by many in its original time) is known as a cult classic.

Reader Response Theories are theories based on pyscho-analysis of the characters to figure out Character Motivations and Goals - including the methods they use to achieve said goals and their aftermath post-achieving the goal. 
They use Psychometry and Psychological Aspects based on:
1. Freudian Psychology
2. Jungian Psychology
