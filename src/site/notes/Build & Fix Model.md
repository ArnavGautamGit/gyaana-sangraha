# Build & Fix Model
> One of the first ever [[SDLC Models\|SDLC Models]] that came into being during the infancy years of Software Development back when computers, computer programs and development of computer programs were very new fields.

The Model states that we collect the requirements from the stakholders (and even the client) to build the 1st version of the Software. Then we showcase the product to the stakeholders.
When the stakeholders suggest any features to be added, redesigned or removed, we make the 2nd version of the product and showcase them. 
This cycle keeps on going on until the stakeholders are satisfied with the delivered product and then the product is deployed.
