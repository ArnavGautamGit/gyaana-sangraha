# Quartered Arms
> Tradition to showcase multiple (more than one) [[Heraldic Achievement\|Coat of Arms]] on the shield by dividing the area into 4 equal quarters with a vertical & horizontal line. 

Used primarily to crete new coat of arms for the child/offspring using the arms of the parents.
Often, if quartering did not exist on either parent's arms before then one of the parent's arms is placed in upper-left & bottom-right (1st & 4th) quarters while the other parent's arms are placed on upper-right & bottom-left (2nd & 3rd) quarters.

### Honorific Positioning of Quarters
1st & 4th quarters are considered more "Honorific Positions" since the 1st quarter is read first when a herald on the jousting/fighting arena introduces a knight to the audience. So for the same reason, in case of parents it is often seen that honorific position is either taken by the parent of higher status or the parent of the same sex of the child.

In case of nations, there may be different Arms for use in different countries like the [[Heraldic Achievement\|Coat of Arms]] of the UK for the use in Scotland are different from the one used in the rest of the UK. Apparently Northern Ireland did not care enough to have the same arrangement when they joined the Union. 

### False Quartering
Some Armigers see different quarters in popular [[Heraldic Achievement\|Coat of Arms]] around the world and think anyone can have quarters on their arms - it is not true. Quartering is one of the [[Divisions of the Shield\|Divisions]] that is granted only upon [[Marshalling of Arms\|Marshalling]] of your parent's arms.
