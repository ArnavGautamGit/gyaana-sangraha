# UAV Aerodynamics & Structural Design
> This Note discusses the Aerodynamics and Structural Design that goes into designing [[Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)\|UAVs]]

the Note is hence split into two halves where one half discusses Aerodynamics and the other discusses Structural Design.

### Aerodynamics Design
On the Aerodynamics side, the idea is to select whether the [[Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)\|UAS]] will be a Rotorcraft or Fixed-Wing. The choice depends on the problem statement and requirements provided for which we are designing the UAV/UAS.

Aerodynamics of the [[Contact Surfaces\|Contact Surfaces]] which generate lift is the primary way of optimising flight in a UAS.
For a Fixed Wing UAS, the contact surfaces are the wings - which generate lift by leveraging a clever combination of the Newton's Third Law and Aerofoil. 
For a Rotorcraft UAS, the contact surfaces are the propellers - which rotate to generate lift.

The [[Aerofoil\|Aerofoil]] is the cross-section of these contact surfaces which may have a constant or non-constant [[Angle of Attack\|Angle of Attack]]. Aerofoil Selection and Design require Graduate Level Expertise in the subject & hence is extremely expensive to hire a good candidate. Not-to-mention that the particular Aerofoil needs to be verifies and tested in a [[Wind Tunnel\|Wind Tunnel]] which is even more expensive.

What Qualities are we looking for in an Aerofoil?
Highest Possible [[Aerodynamic Lift\|Aerodynamic Lift]].
Lowest Possible [[Aerodynamic Drag\|Aerodynamic Drag]].
Highest [[Lift Curve Slope (LCS)\|Lift Curve Slope (LCS)]].
Gentle [[Stall Variation\|Stall Variation]].
Easily Scalable to Mass Production.
Cheaply Producable.

### Structural Design
The Structural Design is needed to add Survivability and Crash-Resistance (also called "*Crashworthiness*") to the UAS.

Structural Protection such as [[Aerodynamic Fairings\|Aerodynamic Fairings]] and Parachutes remain common across UAS designs. In addition to these, Fixed Wing UAS often use Crumple Zones & Airbrakes to keep speed under control. Rotorcrafts often have [[Electronic Speed Controllers (ESCs)\|Electronic Speed Controllers (ESCs)]] which is how it naturally maneuvers by variation of speed provided to multiple rotors.

Structurally, Fixed Wing UAS are very similar to Airplanes - they have a [[Fuselage\|Fuselage]], [[Aerodynamic Wings\|Aerodynamic Wings]], [[Landing Gear (LG)\|Landing Gear (LG)]] and Propulsion System which requires either an Engine or Electric Power. In case of Engine-Powered UAS, there is also an Air Inlet that is incorporated into the UAS.

[[Spars\|Spars]] are the principal structural members of the wing. They correspond to the longeron of the Fuselage. Spars run parallel to the lateral axis of the aircraft, from the fuselage toward the tip of the wing, and are usually attached to the fuselage by a beam, or a truss. Generally, a wing has two spars. One spar is usually located at the maximum thickness, and the other about two-thirds of the distance toward the wingâ€™s trailing edge (in front of flap/control-surface).

Honeycomb structured wing panels are often used in [[Composite Wings\|Composite Wings]]. 

[[Nacelles\|Nacelles]] (i.e., pods) are streamlined enclosures used primarily to house the engine and its components. Engine mounts are also found in the nacelle. These are the assemblies to which the engine is fastened. They are usually constructed from Chrome or Molybdenum steel tubing in light UAV and forged Chrome/Nickel/Molybdenum assemblies in larger UAVs. 

[[Cowling\|Cowling]] are the detachable panels covering those areas into which access must be gained regularly, such as the engine and its accessories. In the design of an [[Airframe\|Airframe]], several factors such as ultimate load, aerodynamic loads (pressure distribution), weight loads (e.g., fuel and engine), weight distribution, gust load, load factor, propulsion loads, landing loads (e.g., brake), and aero-elasticity effects must be considered.
