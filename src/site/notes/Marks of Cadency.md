# Marks of Cadency
> Special Charges added to the [[Heraldic Achievement\|Heraldic Achievement]] of the children when they are using their parent's design to differentiate it from their parent and their siblings on the basis of order of birth.

To "Difference the shield" is the act of adding Marks of Cadency to the shield of the parent (often father) to create a design for the child. 

Although Marks of Cadency are standardised, it is important to note that certain families may use a different charge to achieve the same effect - although the child's order of birth may not be easily estimated but similarity of design would prove descendence. This is often used to avoid confusion. 
Example: Christian Knightly families might have wanted to avoid using a crescent on their secondborn son's shield due to the crescent's connotations of being a turkic or islamic symbol.
