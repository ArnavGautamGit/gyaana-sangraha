# Simulating Zero-Waste Nuclear Reactions
I can use the [[Ramanujan Universe (RU)\|RU]] to simulate certain [[Nuclear Fission Reactions\|Nuclear Fission Reactions]] which can be used to provide [[Nuclear Energy\|Nuclear Energy]] to all homes country-wide and possibly worldwide.

I am sure I am not the first who would give the reaction, I am sure the theory of it already exists but I may as well be one of the firsts in the country to run a practical simulation of the same process and do my bit in research for the country.

The idea is that we can leverage India's Thorium reserves to do two things:
1. Create Nuclear Energy using [[Thorium\|Thorium]]-based reactors which produce minimal waste compared to [[Uranium\|Uranium]] ones.
2. Bypass the rules imposed by the [[Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG)\|Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG)]] on transport & trade of Uranium and Uranium-based Nuclear technology.

### Reaction Process
- Thorium-232 when absorbs a neutron, becomes Thorium-233.
- Thorium-233 decays to form Proactinium-233.
- Proactinium-233 decays to form Uranium-233.
- Uranium-233 is a cleaner fuel than conventional Uranium-235.
- If we can stabilise Uranium-233 to Uranium-235 or Uranium-238, we can bypass NSG regulations.
- India has a rich Thorium reserve and Thorium-enrichment technology is present with Australia which is a fellow [[QUAD\|QUAD]] member.

### Execution of the Plan
1. Run [[GEANT4 Execution Plan\|GEANT4 Execution Plan]]
2. Run them first on our home computers and then in the RU.

### Observations
[[Observations of the First Run\|Observations of the First Run]]
