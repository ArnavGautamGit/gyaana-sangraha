### Era of Colonisation
It is estimated that almost 85% of the World Population was coloniesd by 15% of the colonisers who came mostly from either Europe with the sole coloniser outside Europe being Japan.

The Portuguese & the Spanish were the pioneers in contemporary Colonisation & began fighting amongst themselves for territory. Revolts in their already colonised territories meant they were having a hard time maintaining colonies. The Pope had to step in to avoid Protestant Christian States joining the race of Colonisation. 

Due to the [[Inter Caetera of Pope Alexander VI\|Inter Caetera of Pope Alexander VI]], the Portuguese were given the right to invade the Indian Subcontinent and the Eastern World while the Spanish were given the right to invade the Western World and build colonies in North & South America. Protestant Christian States (like the UK and France) did not really care and invaded everyone & ended up as the largest force of all the Colonisers.

The Indian Subcontinent was colonised by the British while some minor parts of the subcontinent was controlled by the French and the Portuguese. Indonesia & many other countries in South East Asia were colonised by the Dutch & later by the Japanese.

The Germans were late to the Colonisation Game in the 1890s after [[Kaiser Wilhelm II\|Kaiser Wilhelm II]] had taken charge in 1888. To put things in perspective, it had already been more than 30 years since the Indian Revolt for Independence of 1857.

It is important to refresh background notes such as [[European Method of Colonisation\|European Method of Colonisation]] along with [[European Destruction of the Native Americas\|European Destruction of the Native Americas]].

### Politics & Ideologies
Whenever there will be people who try to leverage targic economic conditions to push themselves up the political ladder and claim they can fix anything and all the problems a state has - beware of those people since they are called [[Fascism\|Fascists]].

The Rise of [[Fascism\|Fascism]] and the majority world leaders being men & most of them moving towards proposing War as the only "solution" to all problems, it was interesting to note that the Women began voicing their opinions that the biggest sufferers of Wars are women who lose children, husbands, fathers etc. 

This thought started propogating that men are war-mongerers and the women & children have to stand up for themselves. [[Feminism\|Feminism]] saw a rising number of women supporting it Post-War and took great strides. The thought that women had to conform to societal norms, be effectively banished from working in certain jobs and still had no say in choosing their political leaders even in the "democratic" governments make them not much different than dictatorships for the women. The World Wars brought women in the industries where they talked to men who were yet to be drafted and saw it first hand how a woman's world and a man's world were so drastically different despite potentially coming from the same city or neighbourhood.
