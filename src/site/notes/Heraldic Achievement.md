# Heraldic Achievement
> The unique design & colour combinations used as identifiers in Medieval Europe & records of these were maintained using the practice of [[Heraldry\|Heraldry]]. 

These designs adorned the capes, armours, shields and even for their cavalry!
It was needed since both enemies and friendlies were completely covered from head to toe in similar looking metallic armour made from similar materials (i.e., Steel). This could have led to [[Friendly Fire\|Friendly Fire]], although despite this being one of the more logical theories, it is still contested today.

The basic structure is given on the [Wikipedia Page on Heraldry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heraldry#Heraldic_achievement) and anyone who would like to learn of its details may go there.
