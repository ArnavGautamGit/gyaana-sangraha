# Conjunction Fallacy
> Tendency to wrongly assume that a specific subset ismore likely an answer due to it being more similar to the description regardless of its smaller probability than a superset.

Example: Which is more likely? Airport is closed or Airport is closed due to Bad Weather?
The second case will need to fulfill two conditions instead of one, its probability is obviously going to be lesser than the first one yet most people guess the second option.

With the example, you may have guessed that Conjunction Fallacy is fed by the [[Story Bias\|Story Bias]].
