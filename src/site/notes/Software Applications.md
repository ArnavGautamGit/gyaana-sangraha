# Software Applications
> Here the term "Application" does not refer to applying known knowledge to create or try to build something new. 
> It refers to software programs that we use on our computers, phones, tablets, consoles and other computing devices to perform a specific task or act as an interface between hardware and user.

Since there are different types of software that run on different types of devices - we would require to differentiate the applications so they work best on said hardware & software.

For example, we have the following applications:
[[Desktop Applications\|Desktop Applications]]
[[Mobile Applications\|Mobile Applications]]
[[Website Applications\|Website Applications]]
[[SmartTV Applications\|SmartTV Applications]]

### Development
Developing Applications is as diverse as applications themselves. We have positions in development of different types of apps and such. 
When we talk about [[App Development\|App Development]], it is generally development of Mobile Apps and use frameworks like [[React Native\|React Native]] and [[Flutter\|Flutter]].

Other times when we talk about [[Web Development\|Web Development]], it is generally development of Web Apps which uses HTML, CSS and [[JavaScript\|JavaScript]]. Some may use specific JS libraries like [[ReactJS\|ReactJS]] for the front end and [[NodeJS\|NodeJS]]/[[ExpressJS\|ExpressJS]] for the backend. 

### Security
With the global rise in [[Cyber Crime\|Cyber Crime]] and Cyber Frontiers becoming the new home for war in the form of [[Cyber Warfare\|Cyber Warfare]], it is increasingly important to secure apps. The field dealing with these threats is called as [[Application Security\|Application Security]] - or "AppSec" in short.

It is to be noted that no amount of security can protect apps against disaster incidents like [[AWS Outage of October 2025\|AWS Outage of October 2025]] and [[Crowdstrike Windows Outage\|Crowdstrike Windows Outage]] since the server going out is something that we never expect.
