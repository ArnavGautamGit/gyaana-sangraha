# Fungril
> A [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Ancestries/DH Species Ancestry\|DH Species Ancestry]] of sentient mushroom-like humanoids who can commmunicate with each other through the mycelial array.

Maybe more humanoid than fungal or other way around, recognised by their massive hat-like canopy on top of their head like mushrooms which keeps growing and is generally trimmed by the Fungrils to a shape they desire or can wear gracefully. Canopies may sag if the person gets older.

> [!example] Worldbuilding: Fungrils of Lurov hate Politics
> In [[Lurov\|Lurov]], Fungrils lived all around the world but then they were tired of the Geopolitics and populated a small area near the [[Merman's Forest\|Merman's Forest]] which they named "[[Fungrilia\|Fungrilia]]"

Size of a full-grown Fungril ranges from 2 feet to 7 feet  depending on varieties. In Lurov, the Fungrils in the [[Exile Forest\|Exile Forest]] are average 4-5 feet tall but the fungrils in the [[Feywild\|Feywild]] and [[Fungrilia\|Fungrilia]] are of varying sizes!

On choosing Fungril, you get the following Ancestry Features:
- ***Fungril Network***: Can converse with any other fungril anywhere using mycelial array given that the Fungril can succeed an Instinct Roll against a difficulty (DC) of 12.
- ***Death Connection***: While touching a corpse that passed recently, Fungrils can mark a [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Stress Point\|Stress Point]] to unlock one memory about the corpse related to a specific emotion or sensation.

Lifespan of an Average Fungril: 300 years (rumoured to be much more).
