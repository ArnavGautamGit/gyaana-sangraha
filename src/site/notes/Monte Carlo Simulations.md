# Monte Carlo Simulations
Monte Carlo Simulations are a mathematical technique used to model and analyse complex systems involving randomness and uncertainity. They run on [[Monte Carlo Codes\|Monte Carlo Codes]]

These simulations are consistently used in Finance, Enginnering, Risk Analysis & Management.

Certain services such as [[GEANT4 Simulations\|GEANT4 Simulations]] have specialised the MC Simulations in certain fields like particle physics using.

According to NASA (source: https://www.nasa.gov/monte-carlo-simulation/)
> "MC Simulations is the forefront of Computer-based numerical methods"
