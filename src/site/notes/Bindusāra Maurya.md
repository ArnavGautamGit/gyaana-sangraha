# Bindusāra Maurya
> Second Ruler of [[Mauryan Empire\|Mauryan Empire]] and the son of the first emperor [[Chandragupta Maurya\|Chandragupta Maurya]] known as "Amitrochates" by Greeks based on his Sanskrit nickname "Amitraghāta" which translates to "Slayer of Enemies".

He became the ruler in 297 BC after his father abdicated from the court & retired to [[Vānprastha\|Vānprastha]] after failing to provide & protect his subjects during a famine. His father had not informed his son where he was going as it is traditionally said that in [[Vānprastha\|Vānprastha]], one does not have a fixed address, they keep moving from one place to another. 

### Birth
It is said that [[Vishnugupta Chanakya\|Vishnugupta Chanakya]] used to mix a very small dose of poison in Chandragupta's food & periodically increase it in order to build his tolerance against poison. One day, the Queen while she was pregnant with Bindusāra and less than 1 week from delivery of the child, she was too hungry and took a bite from the Emperor's plate - that one bite was enough to kill her since over time the amount poison Chandragupta could ingest had compounded since his youth years to today.

Chanakya acted quickly to use his knife to open the belly of the Queen and pull out the child to save its life - the child had to be kept inside the uterus of a goat for the next 7 days and after many complications, the child finally lived... some sources say he had a mark on his forehead due to the poison - others say he had marks around his entire body due to the goat's blood but regardless - he was named Bindusāra by [[Vishnugupta Chanakya\|Vishnugupta Chanakya]] himself.

After this incident, [[Vishnugupta Chanakya\|Vishnugupta Chanakya]] left the court and never returned since Chandragupta blamed him for killing his wife & nearly killing his child but let him go due to him being the Guru who not only made him the Emperor in the first place but also saved his child's life. Chanakya returned to his duties as a professor of economy and political economy in [[Takshila University\|Takshila University]].

### Conquests & Reign
His entire regnal life was spent in trying to seek out & bring back his father, as discussed in the note on Chandragupta and he would brutally attack any kingdom that came in his way. He ended many dynasties during his time.

During his [[Vānprastha\|Vānprastha]] years, he came in contact with a [[Jaina (Jainism)\|Jaina]] monk under whose guidance & influence he converted to [[Jaina (Jainism)\|Jainism]] and moved to Shravanbelagova in an attempt to gain moksha. In Jain teachings, if a person feels they are close to attaining Moksha at the end of this very lifetime then they try to cause a faster death first by fasting, then self-harm via plucking nails among other methods.

Chandragupta knew that his son would be coming to look for him & meet him - possibly seeking guidance, being re-attached to him would not only ruin his chance to attain moksha and escape the cycle of life & death but it would also make it hard for him to stay a monk. It would also remind him of his failure as a king - unable to protect his people against a simple famine. So Chandragupta hastened the process beginning with fasting and then nail-plucking and hair-plucking to cause death by pain & bloodloss... by the time Bindusāra found out about his father's location & arrived in Shravanbelagova his father had already passed away. Bindusāra then became the proponent of the [[Ājīvikā\|Ājīvikā]] philosophy where everything is pre-destined and nothing is within your control.
