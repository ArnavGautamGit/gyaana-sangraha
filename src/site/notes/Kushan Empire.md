# Kushan Empire
> An empire of Yuezhi tribal origin mixing heritage from [[Indo-Greeks\|Indo-Greeks]] and [[Ancient Indian Civilisation\|Ancient Indians]].
> The most famous ruler of Kushans was Emperor [[Kanishka\|Kanishka]].

Kushan Empire expanded through Central Asia, India, Afghanistan and also through the part of India that is now Pakistan. They were bilingual who spoke Greek and later learnt Sanskrit. The major scripts in their period were [[Kharoshti Script\|Kharoshti Script]] (for writing [[Gāndhāri Prakrit\|Gāndhāri Prakrit]]) and the [[Brāhmi Script\|Brāhmi Script]] (for [[Sanskrit\|Sanskrit]] and North Indian [[Prakrit\|Prakrit]])

Many Link the Yuezhi tribe (where the Kushans come from) to regions in Xinjiang province of China and other Northwestern areas of Tibet but I could not confirm this. It can be confirmed that the Kushans were from Yuezhi Tribes.

### Demography and Religion
Many Emperors in the Kushan Dynasty such as [[Vasudeva I\|Vasudeva I]] and [[Vasudeva II\|Vasudeva II]] converted towards Hinduism, while many other such as [[Kanishka\|Kanishka]] were Buddhist and propogated the same.
Demographically, the lands were diverse with Hindu, Buddhist, Zoroastrian population

### Two Capitals
While Kushans held other cities which were also quite rich, Kushans were known to have two capitals - [[Purushpur\|Purushpur]] (now Peshawar) for the summer and [[Mathura\|Mathura]] for the Winter.
Kushan Empire was one of the few Empires to conquer Central Asia almost completely and hold it for long enough to make itself rich.

### Coinage & History
They created their own [[Dinar Coins\|Dinar Coins]] made of Gold with smaller denominations using Copper. The local name for the Copper coins is not known, but Dinar was only used for the Gold ones.
Kushans were able to source Gold from the regions of Bactria (modern-day Afghanistan) and traded using Gold they got from taxing the living shit out Chinese, European and Indian traders for each good exported or imported.

Gold and Copper quality was unmatched even by later empires like the [[Gupta Empire\|Gupta Empire]] due to direct connections with major Gold producing locations and trading solely in Gold.

The coins showed bilingual scripts (both [[Kharoshti Script\|Kharoshti Script]] and [[Brāhmi Script\|Brāhmi Script]]) and art from Indian, Mesopotamian and Bactrian (Afghan) origin using Hindu and Buddhist iconography with deities such as [[Lord Shiva\|Lord Shiva]] and [[Gautama Buddha\|Gautama Buddha]] and full potraits of Kushana Kings.
