# Laptop Setup & Guide
> ***THE DAY I GET A NEW LAPTOP, USE THIS NOTE***

First things first, I need to retreive my MEGA Recovery Key.

After that I need to setup the following:
1. VLC Media Player
2. ffmpeg (or its Mac equivalent) and add it to path
3. Brave Browser
4. Google Chrome and Google Accounts
5. MEGA Account
6. iTunes or its newer replacement apps.
7. Command Line Tool named "`yt-dlp`" or its successor.
8. If Windows Laptop/PC, then JHora is good to have.
9. If Windows Laptop/PC and I have more than 512 GB of space, consider FL Studio.
