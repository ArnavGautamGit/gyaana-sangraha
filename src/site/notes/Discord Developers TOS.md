# Discord Developers TOS
> This note is about the TOS (Terms of Service) that developers for Third-Party Bots (now called "Apps") for Discord have to abide by. 
> The link to the actual TOS is [here](https://support-dev.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/8562894815383-Discord-Developer-Terms-of-Service)

I have obviously signed this for the reason that I wish to host the [[DaggerSoul Discord Bot\|DaggerSoul Discord Bot]] on Discord, it is a necessity that I have to host my bot/app on Discord else I probably would not accept these terms.

### Things that I am bittersweet about
1. Section 2(A) states that I am only getting a license for the building apps for Discord. Which is completely fine until you see that it is "revocable". 
2. The conditions for revoking are described in Section 2(B) where there is a lot of stuff about how I am not allowed to harm Discord or its users or its assets using the API (which is obvious and completely fine) but it also includes the following: "(iv) exceeds any API rate, call, or other usage limits we set in our sole discretion" which means that they can make any XYZ excuse about some limit being exceeded and take down my bot. In short, the terms allow any discord employee that handles the developer portal to powertrip.
3. While I cannot use the API to see their code according to Section 2(B) but they can use Section 3(A) to see my code and improve upon the application since by accepting these terms, I grant them the license to do so. They also write in Section 3(A) that "among other things" they can "limit commands from" my Application.
4. I am subject to their terms but they can act [[Holier Than Thou\|Holier Than Thou]] and either avoid signing my terms or render them null & void since in Section 3(A) it also states that "We will not be subject to any terms or policies associated with your Application or App Content (even if we click to agree)"
5. According to Section 6 they deny me my right to even have a vacation or any time off since I am liable to respond to their emails without fail since they state: 

   > "***You agree to respond promptly to our requests to verify and audit your compliance with these Terms***. YOU AGREE THAT DISCORD MAY MONITOR USE OF THE APIS TO ENSURE QUALITY, IMPROVE DISCORD APIs AND OTHER SERVICES, AND VERIFY YOUR COMPLIANCE WITH THE TERMS. ***You will not interfere with this monitoring. Discord may use any technical means to overcome such interference***."
      
   Please Note that the scope of "any technical means" is not defined and they can show up at my house and justify it as "being complient with terms".

6. After the Discord Employee has powertripped, they can shrug it off or pay $100 since the APIs were free and the greater of 0 and 100 is always 100.

> "TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, DISCORD, AND DISCORDâ€™S SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS, WILL ***NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR LOST PROFITS, REVENUES, OR DATA; FINANCIAL LOSSES; OR INDIRECT, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES***.
> TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE TOTAL LIABILITY OF DISCORD, AND ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS, AND DISTRIBUTORS, UNDER OR ARISING OUT OF THE TERMS, ***INCLUDING FOR ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES, IS LIMITED TO THE GREATER OF (I) AMOUNT YOU PAID US TO USE THE APPLICABLE APIS (OR, IF WE CHOOSE, TO SUPPLYING YOU THE APIS AGAIN) DURING THE SIX MONTHS BEFORE YOU FIRST ASSERT A CLAIM OR (II) $100 (OR THE EQUIVALENT IN YOUR LOCAL CURRENCY).***
> DISCORD IS NOT LIABLE FOR THE CONDUCT OR CONTENT, WHETHER ONLINE OR OFFLINE, OF ANY USER OF DISCORD SERVICES. IN ALL CASES, DISCORD, AND ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS, AND DISTRIBUTORS, WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY EXPENSE, LOSS, OR DAMAGE THAT IS NOT REASONABLY FORESEEABLE."
