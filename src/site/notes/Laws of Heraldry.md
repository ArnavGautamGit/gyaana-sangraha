# Laws of Heraldry
> Notes depicting the basic core laws common around Europe for [[Heraldry\|Heraldry]] while also linking to other notes which go through details of varying heraldic traditions.

There are mainly two main laws that are common everywhere:
1. Rule of Tincture
2. Rule of Cadency

Apart from this, I would say there were a few guidelines followed by all the varying traditions in Heraldry. For example: Helmets, Supporters and mantling on arms is heavily regulated.
In most Heraldic jurisdictons, it is not allowed to have supporters unless the right to bear them has been granted to you due to exceptional public service or sacrifice. the type of supporter is also dependent on said granted right.

### Rule of Tincture
This is done so that the colours on any [[Escutcheon\|Escutcheon]] have good contrast so to make it easier to be able to be understood from a distance. 
There are other classes of colours such as [[Heraldic Stains\|Heraldic Stains]] and [[Heraldic Furs\|Heraldic Furs]] but most of the time, the former are considered akin to a tincture while the latter are excluded entirely.

### Rule of Cadency
When a father's Heraldic Achievement is also used by the child, it cannot be used as it is since heraldry is personal, so the children need to difference their heraldic design from their parent's. This could be done by making a slight change in the design or using one of the [[Marks of Cadency\|Marks of Cadency]]
