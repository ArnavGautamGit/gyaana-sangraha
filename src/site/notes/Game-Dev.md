# Game-Dev
The plan is to build Indian-Made games that tell stories about India.
Just like Japanese Storytelling forms (like Anime, Manga) were pioneered by the Japanese...
Games include:
- 2 part-er Racing Games like Upshift and Upshift 2
- Sanātani Universe - 2 games in [["Flute of Dvaapar" Series\|"Flute of Dvaapar" Series]] and the adjoined Universe, 1 game named [[A Loop in Time\|A Loop in Time]] and the final one named [[Pralay\|Pralay]] all made in [[Ren'Py\|Ren'Py]]
- [[Longest Telegram Yet\|Longest Telegram Yet]] - an FPS game about WW3...
- [[Battle of Ten Kings\|Battle of Ten Kings]] - an unlimited game about the Vedic Battle of 10 kings, Bharat won the battle hence got control over India and it was hence called "Bhārat" named after him. It is set in the same universe as Chiranjivi Series.
- In the same Universe, one game on the Mahābhārata and Rāmāyana each.
