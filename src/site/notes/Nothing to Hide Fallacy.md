# Nothing to Hide Fallacy
> The opinion of denying the need for [[Personal Online Privacy\|Personal Online Privacy]] by stating that they have nothing to hide.

It is one of the worst opinions to have in privacy space.
An Average person has enough cameras in their house that if all of them start streaming to the internet, their house will turn into a set of the Indian show "Bigg Boss" (inspired by the show "Bigg Brother") with the sheer number of cameras watching them and recording them at all times.

### Incredibly Naïve to not use Hardware-level protections
With the sheer number of permissions they have given to various parties, it is weird and stupid to actually believe that just because they have restricted the permissions that the cameras are not being used to stream to companies like Google and Meta even though their entire business model is to extract as much data as they can about so that it can be sold to the advertisers at a higher rate citing higher accuracy.

These companies actively try to bypass your restrictions and software permissions for camera and microphone to try and get access and EVEN IF they don't try to violate your privacy, would you trust these software based protections with no backups in the era of hacks, [[Computer Malware\|Malware]], [[Palantir\|Palantir]], [[Pegasus Spyware\|Pegasus Spyware]] and blatant [[Mass-Surveillance\|Mass-Surveillance]]?
