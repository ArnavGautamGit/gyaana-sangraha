# Fifth-Generation Fighter Aircrafts
The New frontier of Fighter Aircraft Technology, these are the future big-dogs of Combat Aviation.
These aim to eliminate dogfights completely altogether.

There are a few criteria an aircraft needs to fulfill before it is termed as a 5th-Gen Aircraft:
1. ***==All-aspect Stealth==***: Characterised as near-invisibility (if not absolute invisibility) in enemy RADAR technology such that either an aircraft is spotted on enemy RADAR when it is too late or it is not seen at all throughout the mission. All-aspect Stea;th refers to the aircraft's ability to hide from all methods of detection.
2. ***==Internal Weapons Bay==***: Weapons on 4th generation aircrafts are visible from the outside as they hang under the wings. Certain 4th-Gen aircrafts have an ability to store some part of its arsenal in an internal bay whereas some weapons stay on external hardpoints {[[Fifth-Generation Fighter Aircrafts#^2\|#^2]]}. Not to mention that displaying weapons outside have the problem of the enemy potentially seeing the missiles in a dogfight or leaked operational images via open sources. Additionally and far more commonly (even at times of peace), external Wing-Mounted hardpoints also create interference in Stealth Capabilities of the Jet since they increase the surface area Radiowaves (used in RADAR tech) can bounce off of.
3. ***==Effortless Supercruising Speed==***: The aircraft must be able to supercruise for long hours effortlessly. It should be able to reach and sustain Supersonic Speeds for a long time without afterburners and without taking away from its ability of All-Aspect Stealth. 
4. ***==Hyper-Manueverability==***: Characterised by the aircraft's ability to quickly change direction on all three axes (i.e., rotation, roll and pitch) and quickly increasing/dropping speed.
5. ***==True Multirole Capability==***: The aircraft (unless made for a specific role {[[Fifth-Generation Fighter Aircrafts#^3\|#^3]]}) can do almost everything you throw at it. The same aircraft (owing to its Stealth and Supercruising Speed) can be used as an Attacker or Bomber and if push comes to shove can be used for dogfights as well (owing to its Hyper-manueverable frame and Supercruising Speed) leading to a truly all-rounded machine.

There are only 3 countries that operate 5th Gen Fighters as of April 2024:
1. United States of America - [[Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor\|Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor]] & [[Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning-II\|Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning-II]]
2. Russia - [[Sukhoi SU-57 Felon\|Sukhoi SU-57 Felon]]
3. China - [[Chengdu J-20\|Chengdu J-20]]

There are countries that want to join the list. These are:
1. India - with their [[AMCA\|AMCA]]
2. Turkey/TÃ¼rkiye - with their [[KAAN\|KAAN]] (engine is in a fix, either f-1110 of the F-16 will be used,or an indigenous one is rumoured. Some rumours about partnership with Rolls Royce)
3. South Korea - with their [[KF21\|KF21]]
4. Japan - with their [[X-2 Shinshin\|X-2 Shinshin]] and they are also working on a [[Japanese 6th-Gen Aircraft\|Japanese 6th-Gen Aircraft]]

2. Hardpoints are fixed points on an aircraft which allows mounting of fuel tanks or a missile arsenal or anything that may need to be dropped. Some Hardpoints may only allow one missile/tank on them and are called ***Pylons***. Others may allow two or more attachments and hence called ***Racks***. Moreover Hardpoints may be internal or external. External Hardpoints although most commonly wing-mounted but now belly-mounted hardpoints are also seen (although only 1-2 on a single aircraft) used most often to carry external fuel tanks (Drop Tanks) since it does not affect Weight Distribution on the wings.

3. US Air Force and the US Navy operate F-22 Raptors and F-35 Lightning-II Aircrafts which are made either specifically for close-range dogfights or specifically for [[Beyond Visual Range (BVR)\|Beyond Visual Range (BVR)]] combat respectively.
