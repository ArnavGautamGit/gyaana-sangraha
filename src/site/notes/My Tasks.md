# My Tasks
> Note gathering all my tasks that I need to finish.

The fact that Obsidian Bases cannot be rendered by the Digital Garden Plugin I use to backup my notes to GitHub means that this entire table of tasks below will be invisible to those using the website to view my notes i.e., my privacy is preserved.

### Why use Obsidian Bases to track Progress?
The reason I use Bases is for the increased loading speed over the Dataview Plugin & the various views in the same base that I can get & switch between on the fly as I wish. The Privacy bit also helps quite a lot.

![[Task Management.base]]

### Comparison Versus Habitica
This Obsidian Bases File may fall out of use over time in favour of moving back to Habitica due to it being always visible in front of my phone screen so that my responsibilities fight my distractions on the same battlefield (my phone).

I still believe that I was more productive back when I was on Habitica.
I will test this hypothesis until my 23rd Birthday on 12th February 2026 to see if this is false or that I should go back to Habitica. If do return to Habitica, I will remove all the notes in any of the views (without removing the views or bases file itself) in favour of [[Back to Habitica\|Back to Habitica]] note listing all my findings & steps to return to Habitica until the company behind it (HabitRPG) shuts down. Just in case that I need to revisit some cancelled tasks, I will also make a new task note named [[List of Cancelled Tasks\|List of Cancelled Tasks]] for documentation purposes.
