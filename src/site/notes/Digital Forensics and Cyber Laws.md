# Digital Forensics and Cyber Laws
> A Subject in my 8th Semester (Last Semester) of my Computer Science Degree at Jaypee Institute of Information Technology (JIIT), Noida.

The Subject is taught by Professor Anshul Singh ma'am. She is a new joinee this year and seems to be a good professor. She has former teaching experience at Lovely Professional University. Before that she was an SDE at Samsung.

My major point of Critique through the semester was how we are taught laws and the cyber security but not any forensic analysis, we are not taught what to look for (in detail) and how to look for it, how to navigate any of the tools needed/used.
