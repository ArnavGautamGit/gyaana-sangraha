# Chess
> Originating in India as "Chaturanga" and later called as "Shataranja" in Persian, it is a game played on a chequered board of 64 squares where each square has a colour alternating between black and white. Since many boards are made of wood, the boards are often also painted with a brown & cream colour-scheme which is used by mixing two woods & is also easier on the eyes.

I started playing Chess with my papa when I was 5 or 6 but then quit after I started going to school and eventually get too engrossed in studies and the rise of Internet Popularity didn't help either.

Chess Tournaments require a chess board where each square of a chess board be from 2-inch to 2.25-inch wide. A livestreamed tournament may use a [[Electronic Chessboard\|Electronic Chessboard]] which connects to a digital chess clock and a wired display - effortlessly synchronising moves made on the board with both of them.

### Chess Theory
Chess Theory leverages the algorithmic nature of Chess to figure out which moves are best to make in certain situations. Chess Theory can be compared to a small academic subject of a limited scope. It involves the following topics:
- [[Chess Piece Values\|Chess Piece Values]]
- [[Chess Opening with White Pieces\|Chess Opening with White Pieces]]
	- [[Compendiums/Chess Compendium/Vienna Opening\|Vienna Opening]]
	- [[London System Opening\|London System Opening]]

### Chess Theory Planning
How you approach Chess Theory must be planned well. You need to know your level (rating) and what rating you want to reach. Then after that you must analyse which openings you encounter most on your level.

IF you are learning chess theory as a beginner, you have two options. Learn to play the openings everyone at your level plays like: 
- [[London System Opening\|London System Opening]] 
- [[Caro Kann Defence\|Caro Kann Defence]]

The other option learn openings that can take down and destroy all openings the opponents most often play. That is:
- Learn a variation or two of the [[Sicillian Defence\|Sicillian Defence]] to counter openings that open with e4.
- [[King's Indian Defence\|King's Indian Defence]] to fight the London System 
- [[Alien Gambit\|Alien Gambit]] to fight the Caro Kann.
