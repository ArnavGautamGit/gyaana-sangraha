# Network Forensics
> Branch of [[Digital Forensics\|Digital Forensics]] aimed at finding, gathering & documenting evidences obtained from a Network of Computers.

Since there may be evidences may be in Digital Format, we must take hard copies & printouts of the Evidence to better protect it against tampering.

The steps of Forensic Analysis are the same as before:
1. Identification of Evidence
2. Preservation of Evidence
3. Collection of Evidence
4. Examination of Evidence
5. Analysis
6. Presentation of Evidence (to authorities)
7. [[Incident Handling\|Incident Response]]

### Explanation with Analogy
Using the analogy of a successful [[Security Incidents\|Intrusion]] on the network, as a part of the Network Forensics team, 
we first find all the evidence of the intrusion in the form of logs, messages or files that were left behind etc. Then we must try to preserve these evidences without damaging or tampering them (example: getting printouts of logs)

We collate all of the obtained evidence in a safe location for examining what exactly happened. After examining and reconstruction of the [[Cyber Crime\|Cyber Crime]], we analyse which weaknesses were exploited and how such events can be prevented.

Now we present the report to the Legal and Development team to file a case/report and also to remove any weaknesses, bugs and vulnerabilities in the code of the service to prevent further [[Security Incidents\|Intrusions]].
