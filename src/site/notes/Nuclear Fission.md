# Nuclear Fission
The Process of Nuclear Fission involves the splitting of 1 nucleus of a [[Fissile Material\|Fissile Material]] by colliding it with a neutron. The process begins with sizable chunk of Fissile Material and the process of Nuclear Fission is performed to produce the purest form of energy known to Mankind. At each step, it also produces one or two free neutrons so that eventually all nucleii of the Fissile Material can be split/fission-ed and maximum energy can be drawn per kilogram of Fissile Material used..

It is needless to say that splitting of nucleii means that the entire atoms also get split.

The process also creates the following byproducts:
1. One or more atoms of a smaller atomic number (possible [[Nuclear Waste\|Nuclear Waste]])
2. Free particles (generally Neutrons, to continue the chain reaction) 
3. Alpha, Beta and Gamma particles (due to [[Radioactive Decay\|Radioactive Decay]])
4. Energy in the form of light and heat

Depending upon the fissile material used, number of neutrons collided, speed of the colliding neutrons and which of the [[Nuclear Fission Reactions\|Nuclear Fission Reactions]] are used, varying proportions of the byproducts are created.

Note: certain byproducts created may showcase [[Radioactivity\|Radioactivity]] meanwhile there exist [[Nuclear Fission Reactions\|Nuclear Fission Reactions]] that do not produce any [[Nuclear Waste\|Nuclear Waste]].

This process is used in both [[Nuclear Fission Reactors\|Nuclear Fission Reactors]] and [[Nuclear Bombs\|Nuclear Bombs]].
