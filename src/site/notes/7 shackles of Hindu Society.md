# The Seven Shackles of Hindu Society
This was also the name of a book by Veer Savarkar which also dealth with the same idea. Even though I have never read the book, the basic idea of the seven shackles is given below to the best of my understanding.

1. ***Vedoktabandi*** - Restriction on the Vedas i.e., exclusive rights to certain class/caste/community to read the Vedas. Savarkar wanted every Hindu to read & understand the Vedas and our cultural heritage within them.
2. ***VyavasƒÅyabandi*** - Restriction on certain classes/castes to practice only certain occupations. Savarkar believed that there must be fluidity in the occupational market.
3. ***Sparshabandi*** - Restriction of certain caste/class from even being touched by others i.e., Untouchability (not practiced everywhere but popular in areas under contemporary Maharashtra - where both Savarkar and Ambedkar have spent a lot of their time). Savarkar wanted to rid the Hindu Society of Untouchability.
4. ***Samudrabandi*** - Exclusion/Restriction from overseas travel. It was believed that anyone travelling overseas cannot be monitored if they are actually following all Hindu traditions or not, hence they are no longer Hindu. Savarkar wanted to make Hindus of the time realise how stupid this is.
5. ***Shuddhibandi*** - Restriction on purity i.e., Restriction on re-conversion once someone converts to Islam, Christianity or any other religion since they become impure. Only Hinduism and Sikhism were considered pure.
6. ***Rotibandi*** - Restriction on Inter-Caste dining. People of certain caste cannot dine with others. Although this was true in other cultures as well since an emperor would never dine with a homeless peasant or anyone not upto his stature anyway regardless of which place they are from.
7. ***Betibandi*** - Restriction on Inter-Caste Marriage. People from certain castes cannot marry outside their castes. Savarkar was vehemently against this.

Savarkar's reasonings to call them shackles was very simple. People from other religions like the Christian Missionaries will target people of the lowest castes first. Tell them that there is no use to being hindu since the hindus don't respect them and put all sorts of restrictions on them - that they cannot marry their daughters to higher social standing men, they cannot even touch the higher castes, they cannot try and improve social standing by starting a new profession or educating themselves with the Vedas to try and become pandits. Once the lower castes will start joining them enmasse, the upper castes could be suffocated by population and their opinions silenced.
If none of that happens then no inter-caste marriage would mean that the genetic pool shall never expand and the kids will always have a weaker immune system, less developed evolutionary features. Hindus will die of genetic incest.
