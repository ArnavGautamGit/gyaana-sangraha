# Charvaka
> A Philosophy that is built purely and completely on Materialism. It States that the Vedas are false and wrong, there is no enlightenment, there is no God. The sole aim of life is to enjoy materialism and as many material possessions as possible!

Such Atheistic school of thought which claimed the VEDAS to be FALSE was still considered as a part of Hinduism. A major one infact!

According to the Charvaka, the only source of knowledge is Perception i.e., they only believe what they see and nothing else.
