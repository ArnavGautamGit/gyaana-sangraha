# Indic Philosophy
Definition:
> Philosophies that took birth in Ancient India. There are many ways to define them, for example, those that came from pre-[[Indian Vedic Period\|Vedic]] others maybe be post-Vedic.

Indic Philosophies are of mainly types developed in many regions - but India is an old enough living civilisation that all kinds of thought could be found here due to having a dense and diverse population for a long long time.

On the basis of faith in God or [[Vedic Literature\|Vedic Literature]] or both, we can classify them into mainly two major types: [[Āstika Philosophies\|Āstika Philosophies]] and [[Nāstika Philosophies\|Nāstika Philosophies]].
