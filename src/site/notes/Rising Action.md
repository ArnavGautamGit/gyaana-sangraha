# Rising Action
> In lIterature & Storytelling, the part of the story after the [[Conflict\|Conflict]] is introduced and the plot starts thickening as it unravels & leads to a [[Climax\|Climax]].

Action does not necessarily mean physical fighting or war - since not every story revolves around the same.
