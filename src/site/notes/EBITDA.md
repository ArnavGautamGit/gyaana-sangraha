# EBITDA
> ***Earnings before [[Interest\|Interest]], [[Tax\|Tax]], [[Depreciation\|Depreciation]] and [[Ammortisation\|Ammortisation]]*** or EBITDA is the Reenue of any business after we remove the [[Sales & Marketing Costs\|Sales & Marketing Costs]] and the [[Cost of General Overheads\|General Overhead Costs]] from the [[Gross Margin\|Gross Margin]].

In a way, it is the profit after we remove ALL the other costs from the [[Net Revenue\|Net Revenue]] which we did not account for in calculaton of [[Gross Margin\|Gross Margin]].

Mathematically, it is calculated as:
$$\Large \text{EBITDA} = \text{Gross Margin} - \text{Other Costs}$$
If your business does not have any debt i.e., you do not have to pay any interests at all, your EBITDA is your operating profit, else you would need to calculate EBDT.
$$\Large \text{EBDT} = \text{EBITDA} - \text{Interest \& Debt Installments}$$
Your business is still yet to pay [[Corporate Tax\|Corporate Tax]] on these earnings though. And you are yet to account for [[Depreciation\|Depreciation]].
