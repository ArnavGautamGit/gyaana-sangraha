The idea is simple, we build Military Drones and sell them to the Indian Army.
Need to implement this after Game-Dev.
The design of the first attack drone allows for VTOL. 
It takes inspiration from Martin 262 Convoy Fighter.

-----
# Martin 262 inspired Drone
### 1.1 Construction
Using Large Electric Motors to spin the propellers, and Solar Panels lined on the top of the plane's wings, it can easily be shortened to become a remotely operated drone... the cockpit could be swapped by a large radar. 
Its smaller size means it can have a similar or even smaller RADAR signature than LCA Tejas itself - probably even wothout any steal coating...
It has 3 tri-symmetrical fins.
And lands and takes off similar to a rocket.
If it needs to have retractable landing gear. We can have them retract inside the wings too if the central fuselage is too full.

### 1.2 Drone Armaments
Under its wing/fuselage it can carry small rudimentary missiles that aren't very heavy.
If the drone is primarily used for scouting by say... the BSF or the Army, along Pak/China Borders or against the Naxals, it can be upgraded to carry an additional RADAR/Camera pointing downwards to capture intel.

### 1.3 Name Ideas:
1. ***INDRA*** - since it uses VTOL technology from its tail-stabilizers. It can carry a multitude of missiles with double hardpoints.
2. ***YAM*** - since it rains down death while remaining unkillable. Designed to be the Attacking STOL variant of the Indra which attacks in numbers and can easily be replaced and mass-produced. Where Indra is best used in Himalayas and Siachen like areas with small landing pads (maybe even aboard the Naval Ships).... Yam is best used on the comparitively flatter borders with Pakistan and China. Also there is a substancial amount of part-sharing among the drones, so there is no question of non-availability of spare parts.

### 1.4 Design
Same as Martin 262 Convoy Fighter except a cockpit delete and addition of toroidal propellers.
No change unless some copyright or patent issue arises.

### 1.5 Versioning
#### 1.5.1 Version 1.0
>Everything is the same as the original idea above, but this is Solar powered on the top... has conventional V-shaped rudder-stabilizers, no VTOL, but STOL instead.... a surveillance drone with Solar-recharge capability thats it. Both internal (at the nose cone) and external radar mounted at the belly. Named as "Indra 001"

#### 1.5.2 Version 1.1
> Gets Air-to-Ground capabilities... retains STOL, becomes bigger in terms of size and wingspan.
> Obviously this creates a new branch of attack-focused line of drones (instead of patrol focused ones)
> Named "Yam 001"

#### 1.5.3 Version 2.0 and 2.1
> Continuation of [[Military Drones#1.5.1 Version 1.0\|#1.5.1 Version 1.0]] and [[Military Drones#1.5.2 Version 1.1\|#1.5.2 Version 1.1]] branch of drone tech respectively. 
> Size upgrade, available with both VTOL and STOL (named Indra 002 and Yam 002)
> Missile Hardpoints added
> Solar-recharging removed on "Indra 002" (since "up" doesn't matter as it is symmetrical on both ends)
> But "Indra 002" Double Missile Carrying Capacity due to having Missile Hardpoints above and below the wing (since it uses VTOL an stands on its tail vertically)

# Quadcopter surveillance Drones
### 2.1 Construction
Made majorly with plastic.
Small in size, only for surveillance.
Only Camera, no weapons - but can be modified to carry one impact grenade or something like Ukraine's small drones.
Range is similar to any other commercially available Quadcopter Drone.

### 2.2 Use-Case
Local Surveillance in J&K.
Surveillance in Valley to spot and counter Pakistani Drones.

### 2.3 Name Ideas
1. Sākshī: A word for "Witness" in Sanskrit.

### 2.4 Challenges
Why would the Military (or the Government) prefer us over the other commercially available ones?
I guess this is reason enough to delay this or maybe start with these at a dirt cheap cost.
