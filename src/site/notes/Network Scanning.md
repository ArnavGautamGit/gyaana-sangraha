# Network Scanning
> A Process of identifying Active Hosts on a Network for [[Social Engineering\|Social Engineering]] or [[Phishing\|Phishing]] Attacks.

It is a direct continuation of: [[DNS-based Footprinting\|DNS-based Footprinting]]

Here we scan for which services are active on the network, what the network topography looks like etc. The Hacker ([[White-Hat Hackers\|ethical]] or [[Black-Hat Hackers\|otherwise]]) tries to generate a map of the network to see what they are dealing with.

Networks can be scanned by using various methods and tools but the most common of them all is via the use of [[TraceRoute\|TraceRoute]] or [[NetMapper\|NetMapper]]. There is another tool known as "MTR" which also has some functionality taken from [[Ping\|Ping]] in addition to [[TraceRoute\|TraceRoute]].

This phase of [[Scanning\|Scanning]] ends when the Network is scanned, the actual analysis of the collected data to find Vulnerabilities is done in [[Vulnerability Scanning\|Vulnerability Scanning]].
