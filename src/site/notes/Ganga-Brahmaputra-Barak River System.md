# Gangetic River System
> River System formed by the River Ganga in the Great Northern Plains of India.

Gangetic River System's main River Ganga is 2,525 Kilometres long and relies on its Indian Tributary of Yamuna and several smaller tributaries arising from Nepal provides the bulk of its flow. Ganga begins its journey from Gomukh in Gangotri Glacier.

Brahmaputra River System's main river Brahmaputra is 3000 kilometres long and has smaller tributaries like the Teesta River originating in Sikkim. Its majorly dependent on rainfall.

### Origin of the Ganga River
Vishnuganga originating from Badrinath and Dhauliganga from Niti Pass form a confluence at Vishnuprayag to form the Alakananda River. The Alakananda gets its flow from its tributaries Nandakini and Pindarganga when they merge into Alakananda at Nandaprayag and Karnaprayag respectively. Later at Rudraprayag, the Mandakini River originating from Kedarnath merges into Alakananda.
Finally Alakananda meets Bhagirathi River at Devprayag to form the Ganga river.

There is conflict in the source stream of Ganga between the scientific and cultural opinion. Where in accordance to science, due to the greater length (among other hydrological criteria) present in the Alakhnanda river's favour, it should be considered as the source stream but in the writings of many Hindu texts, it is considered that Bhagirathi is the source stream.

Ganga truly begins at the confluence of Bhagirathi and Alakhnanda at Devprayag and many sources say that Ganga begins at Devprayag due to this conflict between modern readings versus historical data & beliefs that formed due to early anecdotal evidence.

### Path of the Ganga River
Ganga goes through Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, a small portion of Jharkhand before going into West Bengal until it goes into Bangladesh. 

Yamuna (after being fed by Banas, Chambal, Kali Sindh, Sindh, Betwa and Ken) merges Ganga at the city of [[Prayagraj\|Prayagraj]] where the Kumbha Mela is held in a rotating cycle. I visited the Maha Kumbh in 2025.

The Gomti, Ghagara (its tributary Sharda River), Gandak, Son and Kosi rivers further act as tributaries after crossing Prayagraj. The Sharda River, for a good chunk of the route forms the international border between India and Nepal until the Sharda Sagar Lake. The main Ghagara river, Gandak river and Kosi river travel through Nepal with Gandak originating in Nepal as well.

With the Farakkha Barrage and Canal, around 50% or more of its water (in accordance to the [[Ganga Water Treaty (1996-2026)\|Ganga Water Treaty (1996-2026)]] signed between India & Bangladesh) is diverted into the Hoogly River. The remaining 50% flows into Bangladesh. This lower stream is again called "Bhagirathi" in West Bengal but known as "Padma" in Bangladesh. 

### Origin & Flow of the Brahmaputra River
Brahmaputra is called Yarlung Tsangpo in Tibet when it originates from Lake Mansarovar near Mount Kailash. It is very thin and it gains its volume, speed and water when it enters Arunachal Pradesh where it is known as the Siang/Dihang River. It then flows through Assam where it is known as Brahmaputra or Luit.

The Brahmaputra then flows into Bangladesh and the illiterates in Bangladesh call it the Jamuna (not to be confused with Ganga's Tributary named Yamuna). The River "Jamuna" then merges into Padma.

The Teesta River is a 414 kilomtre-long tributary of the Brahmaputra that begins in Sikkim and flows down touching Gangtok, Darjeeling, Jalpaiguri and Cooch Behar districts into Bangladesh where it merges with Brahmaputra River.

### Origin & Flow of the Barak River
Barak river originates in Manipur and flows from Tripura into Bangladesh where it is called Meghna. It later merges into the Padma river (which is hereafter called the former due to the former having higher volume of water) and then the Meghna drains into the Sundarban Delta. With a big chunk of Sundarban on Indian side being formed due to the River Delta of the Hoogly River.

### Exotic & Exclusive Fauna
The Ganga River System is famous for Gharial and South Asian River Dolphins whereas the Brahmaputra is said to sustain the Great One-Horned Rhino in Assam and the surrounding regions.
