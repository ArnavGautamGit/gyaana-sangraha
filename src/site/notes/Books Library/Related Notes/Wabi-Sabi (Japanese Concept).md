# Wabi-Sabi (Japanese Concept)
> A Japanese Concept that talks about the beauty in fleeting, changeable, imperfect nature of the things around us. It is thought that the imperfections are what create beauty.

In the book "[[Books Library/Ikigai - The Japanese Secret to a Long and Happy Life\|Ikigai - The Japanese Secret to a Long and Happy Life]]", the two authors claim that the Japanese think a cracked cup or cracked flower vase is more beautiful than a completely perfect one (I assume they are talking of philosophers and not normal people)

In reality, I feel that this is a teaching used to teach the Japanese kids the value of time since one day the vase or cup will crack (or be '*imperfect*') and the beauty or value of the object is not the shape, perfection or resale value of the cup but the real values rest in "the memories we made along the way".

As an example authors of the book have given an example of Japanese Architecture being built out of wood instead of stone so that the future generations have to rebuild them and reinforce the idea of impermanent nature of things which will fade away with time. He cites Grand Shrine of Ise which was rebuilt every 20 years.

### Personal Conclusion
- Keep your skills sharp and diverse
- Regular practice in your craft
- Bruce Lee's famous quote "Be Water, my friend" comes to mind.
