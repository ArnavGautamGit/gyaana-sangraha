# Classes & Objects
> Basic units of programming where a certain kind of similar elements (defined by having common attributes/variables) is called a class and each unique element within a class is called an object.

Example: The term "Car" can be used as a Class whereas the Volkswagon Polo or Maruti 800 are specific objects in the Car class since they are unique models of cars - even if they have different manufacturers.

### Class Variables
Any class may also contain its own variables which remain the same across all objects even if their values change. Sticking to the same example as before, all cars would have engines, airbags among other such attributes, some cars may have a different engine and number of airbags (especially if manufacturer is different)

### Access Modifiers
Specific words and phrases that modify access to the Class Variables depending upon whether [[Functions in Programming\|Functions]] from inside the Class or Outside the class want to use them.

In C++ and Java, there are three main types of Access Modifiers: Public, Private and Protected which provided access to all functions, class functions and Class & Child Class Functions only (via [[Inheritance (Programming)\|Inheritance]]).

Default Access Modifier is "private" in most (if not all) programming languages.
They are useful in hiding sensitive data and for basic program-level [[Data Privacy\|Data Privacy]].
