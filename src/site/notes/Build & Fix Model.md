# Build & Fix Model
> The first ever among the [[SDLC Models\|SDLC Models]] which came into being during the infancy years of Software Development back when computers, computer programs and development of computer programs were very new fields. Build & Fix was not explicitly developed, it was based on basic common sense of the times.

The Model states that we collect the requirements from the stakholders (and even the client) to build the 1st version of the Software. Then we showcase the product to the stakeholders.

When the stakeholders suggest any features to be added, redesigned or removed, we make the 2nd version of the product and showcase them. 
This cycle keeps on going on until the stakeholders are satisfied with the delivered product and then the product is deployed.

| Leads to Fastest Deployment                                                                   | Results in Poor Quality Product                                                                |
| Every change happens only with client's review and permission.                                | The Client's Scheduled Deadline and Budget for the project may be exceeded.                    |
| Better Visibility in Client's eyes. Client knows exactly what is being built & feels involved | Client's user-base may have expectations that are not met.                                     |
|                                                                                               | Dodgy quality has caused many Software failures in the past (back when the model was popular). |
