# Investment Plan
> A plan to invest and hold in the market for 20-30 years and grow my corpus faster than [[Inflation\|Inflation]].

Plans for investing must always be divided into sections according to risk and return profiles. It is widely known that Short-Term investing Strategies tend to be a high-risk high-reward endeavour and as the term length increases, risk decreases. [[Mutual Funds\|Mutual Funds]]

### Pre-requisites
[[My Health Insurance\|My Health Insurance]]
[[My Term Life Insurance\|My Term Life Insurance]]
[[My Emergency Fund Plan\|My Emergency Fund Plan]] using Liquid Funds so withdrawal is fluid.

### The Actual Investment Plan
If my investment prinicpal amount is X, I will use 70% of this amount and put in an [[Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs)\|SIP]] of an [[Index Mutual Fund\|Index Mutual Fund]]. 

The other 20% is an Opportunity Fund. Whenever NIFTY falls by some percentage (around 5%) then I can invest this Opportunity Fund in there and whenever some of the stocks in my [[Personal Stock Market Portfolio\|Personal Stock Market Portfolio]] fall by some percentage (around 5%) then I will invest my Opportunity Fund there.

The last 10% is for Shorter-Term Investsments like [[Treasury Bills (T-Bills)\|Treasury Bills (T-Bills)]], [[Debt Mutual Fund\|Debt Mutual Fund]].

How to maintain an Opportunity Fund?
When you get a salary every month, find out what percentage of your salary you can invest in the market. As a rule of thumb, as long as neccessities are taken care of, keep the investment amount around 20% and put this money in a different Investment-only Bank Account.

When getting married, instead of asking for a big-fat wedding, ask for a small wedding but with big-fat gifts instead. If instead of spending 1Cr on your wedding, your parents can spend 40L on the wedding and give you 40L worth of [[Physical Gold Purchases\|Physical Gold Purchases]] or [[Sovereign Gold Bonds (SGBs)\|Sovereign Gold Bonds (SGBs)]] either of them are MUCH better than just a lavish venue and clothing. 
Pro tip is to always approach Jewellers who you know can give good rates (often jewellers you know personally). Eventually build [[Personal Real Estate Investments\|Personal Real Estate Investments]] of your own (combined with any you have inherited).
