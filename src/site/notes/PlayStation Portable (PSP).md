# PlayStation Portable (PSP)
> Legendary Handheld gaming console launched in 2004 that was truly ahead of its time and offered Remote Play with PS3 (so you can remotely enjoy PS3 games from your handheld) before screenshare was that popular for work (let alone games)!!

The PSP used a small disc format called "Universal Media Disc (UMD)", it was basically a small disc encased in a protective case of its own that cannot be taken off. a single layer UMD could hold 900 MB and dual layer one could hold 1.8 GB too.

Since the disc came in its own protective case, it was easy for kids to handle the disc and the disc was read from a small window in the case i.e., the surface you needed to protect was very small.

## My Journey with the PSP
My PSP was a gift from Shyam Maama when I was 6 years old in 2009. My cousin sisters were really sad when I took the PSP and I still remember their long faces when I was leaving their house with the PSP in hand. In my defence, I meant (and repeatedly mentioned) buying a new one for me not because I considered this one "used" (Kohi & Kohen were as close to me as siblings and such trivial things were never an issue plus they had just got that PSP for themselves anyway) but I wanted Maama to gift me a new one because I KNEW taking away the PSP both my cousins share would make them sad and I did not want that. 

In sometime between 2013 to 2014 I had gone to Ramnagar in my summer vacation with Maama's family which is where I was happy to figure out that Kohi & Kohen eventually got their own individual PSPs instead of sharing the same one after the shared PSP went with me. We played a lot of PSP together and tried out each other's games but we did not know about Ad-Hoc (local multiplayer) not to mention we probably did not have multiplayer games anyway... 

Some time later when I was in Ramnagar (at Shyam Maama's property where I would often spend my summer vacation as a child) I was at Arjun's place. Sadly I never knew his full name but he was a neighbour and a family-friend, who eventually became my close friend. I was at his house when I got to know that he also had a PSP but unlike me (who had 4 discs), he had a wall of games... 
While hurriedly packing up my discs, I "accidentally" placed the disc of HIS game in the cover of MY game. In that exchange got "Medal of Honor Heroes 2" while he got "Rush". Arjun probably also thought that he got the shorter end of the stick (I hated Rush anyway).

Since Arjun was quite elder to me even when we first met, when I met him for the second (the last time I went to Ramnagar) in the summer of 2018 or 2019... he still remembered that our games got exchanged, sadly I did not have his disc to exchange with my own at the time and till date in 2026, unless he has thrown away my Rush disc we still have each other's disc.

Between these two visits to Arjun's house,
In 2017, I went to Ramnagar with my school friends! Aviral, Aaryan, Adit, Sarthak and his brother Sambhav. Aviral and Aaryan came in my car with me while we had a lot of fun together playing on our PSP. The shared PSP of Aaryan & Adit was with Adit who was coming by Sarthak's car. We had a ton of fun there & shared games. Unknown to us that Ad-Hoc feature could work for us but PSP wasn't popular for multiplayer games anyway and I think Ad-Hoc required all the PSPs to be in the same Wi-Fi. Ramnagar is a rural town which had poor internet connectivity - not to mention how unreliable 2000s internet was.
