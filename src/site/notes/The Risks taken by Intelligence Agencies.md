# The Risks taken by Intelligence Agencies
> Note detailing most of the lethal risks that are taken by Intelligence Agencies in the world when working another country.

These Risks include (but not limited to) situations when spies need to planted in another country or when collaborating with another agency.

### Planting your Agent in a Foreign State
Many Inteligence Agencies go through the trouble of getting their agents/spies a cover story, teach them about local nuances instead of just the language of the target country/community.
Some may go to lengths of securing them citizenship of the Target [[State (United Nations)\|State]] or permanent stay with a cover job.

A lot of the times, the spies may change their mind through the long process, quit mid-way, chicken out at the time of the entry or something else. The process of settling a spy in another state takes many years! The Risks are only amplified if the target state is not as good of a place to live as the spy's home country.

Due to these risks involved, agencies prefer to raise sources among the people who are already citizens/part of the target country/community respectively. Usually people with credible standing with the higher level employees working at places of interest.

### Collaboration with another Agency
Joint Collaborations in Intelligence are rare for the reason that Intelligence is not easy to find and the process to get one's hands on it is dependent on ommunication.
When there are 2 agencies working together, it just doubles the layers of communication & slows the process down. Not to mention it adds more variables and more parts that can fail.
Showing another [[State (United Nations)\|State]] what all one knows is always risky since one cannot know whether the other state will use it against them or not.
