# The Treaty of The Indus (303 BC)
> Treaty signed between the [[Mauryan Empire\|Mauryan Empire]] and [[Selucid Empire\|Selucid Empire]] to confirm the formal transfer of territory from the control of [[Selucus I Nicator\|Selucus I Nicator]] to [[Chandragupta Maurya\|Chandragupta Maurya]]. 

During the time from 305 BC to 303 BC, [[Selucid Empire\|Selucid Empire]] was defeated multiple times by the [[Mauryan Empire\|Mauryan Empire]] and eventually the territories of [[Gāndhāra\|Gāndhāra]], Paropamisadae, Gedrosia, Arachosia and Aria fell into Mauryan hands.

### Three Clauses of the Treaty
In 303 BC the Treaty was officially signed and had three main clauses in it.
First Clause was regarding marital alliances, [[Chandragupta Maurya\|Chandragupta Maurya]] married the daughter of [[Selucus I Nicator\|Selucus I Nicator]]. Second Clause was official transfer where Selucus would officially acknowledge in writing & official Selucid maps that eastern territories now belong to the Mauryans. Thirdly, as a diplomatic token, Chandragupta gifted 500 trained war elephants to the [[Selucid Empire\|Selucid Empire]]. It is said Chandragupta & Selucus shared a warm relationship afterwards as in-laws.

### Aftermath in Indian, Greek & Persian relations
The trade between India & Greeks increased, many of the Selucid Empire soldeirs converted to [[Bauddha (Buddhism)\|Buddhism]] & [[Hinduism\|Hinduism]] and slowly transitioned into a new distinct ethnicity popularly called as the [[Indo-Greeks\|Indo-Greeks]]. It is also said that there was a flow of [[Hellenistic Art\|Hellenistic Art]] into India & the local coinage also reflected some changes with both sides adopting cultural motifs from one another.

Overtime, trade customs became standardised among the two Kingdoms and trade flourished between them. [[Selucid Empire\|Selucid Empire]] & [[Mauryan Empire\|Mauryan Empire]] began seeing each pther as relatives or allies & slowly the notion that Persians are the sister civilisation to India got stronger. Even after the [[Islamisation of Persia\|Islamisation of Persia]], it was not until [[Nadir Shah\|Nadir Shah]] in the late medieval ages (2000+ years) that Persia ever rose a sword against India & vice-versa.
