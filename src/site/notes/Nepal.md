# Nepal
> [[State (United Nations)\|UN Member State]] on the border with [[India\|India]] and Tibet (China since 1959). It is one of the most impportant Cultural centres for [[Hinduism\|Hinduism]] outside India itself. Although people of Nepal are also sometimes called "Nepalese", the government officially wants the use of the term "Nepali" for both the people & language.

Nepal is also the country where Devi Sītā and Gautama Buddha were born across different eras and had come to India from the regions that are now under modern-day Nepal. 75% of the population of Nepal is Hindu.

### Demography
Most of the people in Nepal are young - since the Demography is youthful (similar to India) with Gen Z being in heavy numbers. People are mostly of [[Gorkha\|Gorkha]] origin and live peacefully unless provoked They speak the [[Nepali Language\|Nepali Language]] with some minority people in Nepal's lower or plains region being able to understand Hindi but prefer Nepali.

### Regime Change in 2025
Recently in 2025, the Students of Nepal staged a protest and got rid of the government in their country by force under the [[Nepalese Student Protest (2025)\|Nepalese Student Protest (2025)]] after Nepalese government decided to instruct the military to open fire on the protesting students - this sparked the protest to become much more widespread.

### Ongoing Border-Issue with India
Currently, India & Nepal relations are strained by [[India-Nepal Kali River Border\|India-Nepal Kali River Border]] inconsistencies since Nepal believes in the different geographical origin of the Kali River changing the border to their benefit. The reason this is being raised now is that [[Lipulekh Pass\|Lipulekh Pass]] is used by many Indian tourists each year to go for [[Kailash-Mansarovar Yatra\|Kailash-Mansarovar Yatra]] Pilgrimage which Nepal seeks to monetise.
