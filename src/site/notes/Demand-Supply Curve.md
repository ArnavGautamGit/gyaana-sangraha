# Demand-Supply Curve
> An important Curve in [[Economics\|Economics]], that maps the [[Demand\|Demand]] & [[Supply\|Supply]] on X-Axis with respect to Price on Y-Axis.

Increase in either demand or supply would mean there is an increase in quantity demanded or supplied i.e., increase in either would mean that the curve shifts to the right and decrease in either is reflected by shifting the curve towards left. 

Demand-Supply Curve is used to map the change in price of the product with the change in either supply or demand. Although in real time both supply and demand can change together, here we generally keep one of the two as constant.

| Demand    | Supply    | Price          | Reason                                        |
| --------- | --------- | -------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Increases | Increases | Heavy Increase | The intersection of demand & supply is higher |
| Increases | Constant  | Increases      | Demand curve intersects higher on the supply  |
| Constant  | Increases | Decreases      | supply curve intersects lower on the demand   |
| Decreases | Decreases | Heavy Decrease | The intersection of demand & supply is lower  |
