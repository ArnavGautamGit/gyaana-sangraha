# Wind Energy
> Harnessing Kinetic Energy present in moving wind to convert it into Mechanical Energy and possibly other forms of energy (mostly electrical). 

We have documented use of Wind Energy by Millers from at least 15th Century CE but converting the Mechanical Energy into Electrical Energy is a relatively new phenomenon in history.

Wind's Kinetic Energy was earlier converted to Mechanical Energy through the shaft and with the help of gears, it woul help mill the grain. Which is why a Wind Turbine was called "Windmill" back in the day. Milling grains with the help of wind. Milling was also done using Water wheels in [[Watermill\|Watermill]].

Now, if we connect the shaft to a gearbox which connects to a generator, we can generate Electricity! This power is called "Wind Power".
The entire subject is around how much power can be generated from one "Windmill" or "Wind Power Plant".

To understand power output, we first understand how is a Wind Turbine made.
A Wind Turbine has 2 main components: [[Axis Direction\|Axis Direction]] and [[Rotor Type\|Rotor Type]].
