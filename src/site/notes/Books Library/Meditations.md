# What is *"Meditations"* about?
It is a book that is a posthumously published as a collection of all the notes from the collection of personal diaries of Roman Emperor [[Books Library/Related Notes/Marcus Aurelius\|Marcus Aurelius]] after his death by the members of his court.

This book along with the book by [[People/Seneca\|Seneca]] titled, "[[Books Library/Letters from a Stoic (Book)\|Letters from a Stoic (Book)]]" lay & detail the foundation of one of the greatest western philosophy of Greek origin known as "[[Books Library/Related Notes/Stoicism\|Stoicism]]".

### Why is Marcus Aurelius still relevent?
Marcus Aurelius was by far known as one of the first Stoics to ever exist - along with Seneca and some of his other contemporaries. He was one of the most influencial & powerful kings who were more than a spike in the history of Empires (like [[People/Alexander The Great\|Alexander The Great]]). The reason I call Alexander a spike in history, is that his empire fell just as fast as it rose. The Roman Empire ruled for around 800 years! Understanding his philosophy, psychography and other such features - makes him one of the most relevant figures in a time when we are too distracted with attention spans smaller than a Goldfish.

### Buying Tips & Critique
My edition that I bought was sold by the Om Book Shop as a part of their unabridged classics in their store inside the "DLF Mall of India", in Noida Sector 18. It contains no commentary since that is the kind of books I like - often come cheaper and free from thoughts of someone else. I can find the truth my own way, free from the commentator's biases.

Yet, this book I would say sometimes did require me to stop to think, for multiple days in fact. The concepts of Providence & [[Books Library/Related Notes/Marcus Aurelius\|Marcus Aurelius]]'s faith in Gods is a hard concept to grab without a commentary.  It is not easy, but not hard either. Such concepts about Providence are also recurring - making them one of the most important features to understand if one wishes to understand the book.

I would recommend going for the edition without commentary if you do not want to affect your thoughts with the potential biases of the commentator.
