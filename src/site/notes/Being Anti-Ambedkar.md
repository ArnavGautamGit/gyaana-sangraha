# Being Anti-Ambedkar $\large\neq$ Being Casteist 
Some would say there was no need to say this but I think there is a need to draw a distinction between the two statements.

Yes, I do not agree with 90% of what Ambedkar did and said. I have read all the 12 volumes of *"Dr. BR Ambedkar: All Writings and Speeches"* released by the Government of Maharashtra and I will also admit that I do not like the man and have talked very openly about his little-known dark side [[Dr. Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar#Ambedkar's Dark Side\|here]].

But that does not mean I am Casteist. Just like not liking milk doesn't make you Lactose Intolerant, not liking Ambedkar does not make you a Casteist - both are called having a preference.
