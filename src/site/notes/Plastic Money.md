# Plastic Money
> Debit & Credit Cards made by [[VISA\|VISA]], [[MasterCard\|MasterCard]] and [[RuPay\|RuPay]] Card Networks. Not to be confused with [[Plastic Currency\|Plastic Currency]] which are notes made with Plastic instead of cotton/paper.

These Card Networks earn by taking a convenience cut from the transaction-in-question called as the [[Merchant Discount Rate (MDR)\|Merchant Discount Rate (MDR)]]. It is often charged on the merchants although merchants often transfer this cost on consumer unless it is an online e-commerce platform where MDR is added to the cost.
