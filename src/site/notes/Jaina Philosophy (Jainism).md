# Jaina Philosophy (Jainism)
> Jainism, originally called the "Jaina" in Sanskrit is a philosophy-turned-religion which preaches non-violence and a set of core tenets provided and preached by the Jain gurus called "[[Tīrthānkara\|Tīrthānkara]]".

The followers of Jainism are called Jains. It is said that the term "Jain" refers to a follower of the [[Tīrthānkara\|Jina]], this is consistent with Prakrit & Sanskrit rules of grammar. 
The term "Jina" is often used interchangably with the term "[[Tīrthānkara\|Tīrthānkara]]".

### Formation of Jainism
Most stories regarding Jain History and Jainism trace back to King Vardhaman who was born in 540 BC in Basara (Vaishali of present-day Bihar). It is said that Vardhaman lived a royal life till the age of 30. 

Due to certain chain of events, King Vardhaman starts looking for purpose and meaing. He goes so far into spirituality that he has the realisation that clothes themselves are a social construct that the people wear to avoid showing the private-most sexual or secondary sexual organs to everyone out of shame since they are the foremost cause of insecurities among others. Vardhaman decided to let go of clothing as well roughly 12 years into his journey when he achieved [[Kaivalya\|Kaivalya]] at the age of 42.

Vardhaman is since then known as [[Swāmi Vardhaman Mahavir\|Mahavir]], the 24th and final [[Tīrthānkara\|Tīrthānkara]] in Jainism and only the second one for whom we have cross-verifiable evidence in [[Archaeological Evidence\|Archaeological Records]] on top of Jain Literature. The first Tīrthānkara to have been verified as an existing person with literary AND archaeological records was Parsavnath (the 23rd Tīrthānkara). Previous Tīrthānkaras only have literary evidence on their side. According to Jain Texts, the first Jain Tīrthānkara is Raishabdev ji (his name is also spelled "Rishabdev" in many places)

### Core Principles & Tenets
According to Jainism, God is unattainable (often kept below a Tīrthānkara) if he exists and the only way to attain god is to reach a certain level of spiritual prowess which can be achieved only by following the path of previous [[Tīrthānkara\|Tīrthānkaras]] which include the following 5 vows:

1. Satya ---> Never Speak a Lie
2. Ahimsā ---> Do not commit violence
3. Aparigraha ---> Do not acquire land (by force)
4. Asteya ---> Do not steal anything
5. Brahmacharya ---> Become a [[Brahmachāri\|Brahmachāri]] (added by Vardhaman Mahavir ji).

It is said that one needs 3 Ratnas (Ratnatraya) to walk this path. These 3 ratnas are: 
1. Right Belief 
2. Accurate Knowledge
3. Righteous Action

Similar to [[Hinduism\|Hinduism]], the concept of attaining [[Moksha\|Moksha]] is the ultimate goal for a living being on earth & it is dependent upon Karma. No person who has committed bad karmas repeatedly can get Moksha in Jainism. Unlike [[Hinduism\|Hinduism]] and [[Bauddha Philosophy (Buddhism)\|Buddhism]], a person who is a [[Grihasta\|Grihasta]] cannot attain Moksha, only a [[Brahmachāri\|Brahmachāri]] can.

### Founder of Jainism
Although the first [[Tīrthānkara\|Tīrthānkara]], [[Shri Ādinātha Rishabhdev\|Shri Ādinātha Rishabhdev]] ji is often considered the founder, but [[Swāmi Vardhaman Mahavir\|Swāmi Vardhaman Mahavir]] is considered the real founder since he did the major codification of the religion into a separate entity from [[Hinduism\|Hinduism]].

Under the influence of [[Bhadrabāhu (Jain Monk)\|Bhadrabāhu (Jain Monk)]], the founder of [[Mauryan Empire\|Mauryan Empire]], Emperor [[Chandragupta Maurya\|Chandragupta Maurya]] accepted [[Jaina Philosophy (Jainism)\|Jainism]] before committing [[Sallekhan (Santhara)\|Sallekhan (Santhara)]].

### Digāmbara vs Shwetāmbara Jains
While the Southern Indian jains had no issues in staying cloth-free due to southern india being a hotter tropical climate vs the cooler northern temperate climate (especially in winter). 
Northern Indian Jains eventually started wearing some clothes - but all white. 

These sects divided into [[Dīgāmbara Jains\|Dīgāmbara Jains]] & [[Shwetāmbara Jains\|Shwetāmbara Jains]] sects which are translated as sky-clad (nude) and white-clad (white clothed). This created massive intellectual fueds between them which led to the southern Indian ones invalidated 14-purvas made in the [[First Jain Council of 300 BC\|First Jain Council of 300 BC]] in Pataliputra & chained by [[Sthulbhadra\|Sthulbhadra]] in 300 BC.

These intellectual divisions could not be sorted until the [[Second Jain Council of 512 AD\|Second Jain Council of 512 AD]] which was 812 years since the First Council. The Second Council under the [[Chalukya Dynasty\|Chalukya Dynasty]] in Gujarat (in Vallabhi to be specific) chaired by Devardi Khemasarmana where both the sects accepted each other and wrote 12 angas, 12 upanga, 10 chheda texts - all of which were accepted by both the sides.
