# Dark Web
> One of the [[Layers of Internet\|Layers of Internet]] which originated as a small part of the [[Deep Web\|Deep Web]] which could only be accessed by the [[The Onion Router (TOR)\|The Onion Router (TOR)]] browser & network.

Dark Web is often seen in conjunction with Criminals now.
People fall into the bias of using [[False Causality\|False Causality]] to believe that people who are active on the Dark Web must also be affiliated or connected to the Cyber Criminals who use the Anonymity provided by the network for their advantage. 

### Creation
Created by the U.S Government and frequently surveiled by both the [[Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)\|Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)]] and the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)\|Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)]]. The former even has a website hosted on the Dark Web.

### Working
The Dark Web works on the [[The Onion Router (TOR)\|The Onion Router (TOR)]] network - which are a bunch of [[Anonymous Proxy Servers\|Anonymous Proxy Servers]] spread across the world. The starting and ending nodes of the network chain from source device to destination website (except the source and destination itself) can be volunteered for.

The Anonymous Proxy Servers anonymise the data encrypted by them and hence make the users anonymous on the Dark Web. It also means that this special network would also need the hosts of the websites to be anonymous as well which is why there is no [[Domain Name Service (DNS)\|Domain Name Service (DNS)]] available for the Dark Web and all the links end with a .onion domain & all the links need to be noted down or memorised regardless of their length.

However it is important to note that the Proxy Server Path the device's signal takes can be traced i.e., even though the [[The Onion Router (TOR)\|TOR]] network offers anonymity, it still makes the users traceable. This is how Robert Ulricht - the founder of The Silk Road onion site was traced and arrested by the authorities.
