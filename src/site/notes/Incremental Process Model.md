# Incremental Process Model
> A reformed type of the [[SDLC Models\|SDLC Model]] which is a successor to the [[Waterfall Model\|Waterfall Model]] and made to reduce the errors in the same.

The Model focuses on dividing the software solution into smaller modules at the design stage after Requirements have been gathered. For Example: a game can be divided into many modules such as: Map Design, Character Design, UI etc.

In one go, the developers only work on one module as a singular increment (like just working on map design) then the developers showcase the increment to the stakeholders & in the next $\large (n+1)^{th}$ increment make any fixes or changes before moving to working on the next module in the $\large (n+2)^{th}$ increment instead.

Here, each increment is like a [[Waterfall Model\|Waterfall Model]] implementation of its own.

| Problems and Changes are handled immediately.                                                                             | Actual Cost may exceed estimate due to dynamic addition of more and more increments to fix past ones.           |
| Dynamic Project Requirements are no issue for this model.                                                                 | Needs to be custom made for each project. Needs extra time in Requirement Analysis.                             |
| Can work with smaller or larger staff according to requirements of the projects.                                          | Allowing or Disallowing concurrency is dependent upoin individual application/project. Although it is favoured. |
| Great Visibility with Client. Client has easy access to reports and each increment is presented to them before moving on. |                                                                                                                 |
