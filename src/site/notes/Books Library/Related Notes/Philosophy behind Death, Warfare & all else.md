# Philosophy behind Death, Warfare & all else
In the 17th verse of the 2nd Book of [[Books Library/Meditations\|Meditations]],
[[Books Library/Related Notes/Marcus Aurelius\|Marcus Aurelius]] said the following:

> [!quote] Quote: *Meditations 2:16*
> "The duration of Man's life is but an instant; his substance is fleeting, his senses dull; the structure of his body is corruptible; the soul is but a vortex. We cannot reckon with fortune, or lay our account with fame. In fine, the life of the body is but a river, and the life of the soul is a misty dream. Existence is a warfare, and a journey in a strange land; and the end of fame is to be forgotten. What then avails to guide us? One thing and one thing alone - Philosophy. And this consists of keeping the divinity within inviolate and intact; victorious over pain and pleasure; free from temerity, free from falsehood, free from hypocrisy, independent of what others do or fail to do; submissive to hap and lot, which come from the same source as we; and, above all equanimity awaiting death, as nothing else than a resolution of the elements of which every being compounded. And if in their successive interchanges no harm befall the elements, why should one suspect any in the change and dissolution of the whole? It is natural and nothing natural can be evil.
> At Carnuntum."

Marcus first talks about how in Death, one's life, substance and senses are all fleeting.
He refers to the Impermanence of Human Life - comparing it with the ever-flowing river and a misty dream. The disorientation and challenges faced here are represented by comparing it with Warfare.

Marcus advises that one uses Philosophy to guide themselves through this life. Using Stoicism in particular (since that is the philosophy he follows). It involves in keeping one's mind free from pain, pleasure and external opinions, avoiding hypocrisy and falsehood. Marcus advises to not be overtly dependent on other's actions or approval. He proposes that one only try to worry about what one can control and the action one can take to ease the situation.
