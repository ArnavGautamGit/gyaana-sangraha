# Infrared Activity
> Infrared Activity is a measure of how much Infrared Radiation an atmospheric atom absorbs in accordance with [[Conditions for Molecular Energy Transfer\|Conditions for Molecular Energy Transfer]]. 
> Naturally, atoms that are Infrared Inactive do not absorb Infrared Radiation.

In [[Climate Modelling\|Climate Modelling]], Infrared Activity or IR Activity is important since Infrared carries majority of sun's heat energy meaning ***IR Active molecules contribute to [[Climate Change\|Climate Change]] whereas IR Inactive molecules do not.***

Although some Infrared Active molecules are needed - since without them the Earth will remain cold and frozen and probably will never get proper temperatures to support life. Some Essential IR Active molecules include [[Ozone\|Ozone]] and Water Vapour ($\large H_2O$).

Infrared Active Elements that are unessential should be kept in check - like Carbon Dioxide ($\large CO_2$).

## What makes a molecule IR Active?
We know that each molecule has many different [[Dipole Moment\|dipole moments]] inside it which may or may not cancel out to give zero dipole moment. Good Example is Water ($\large H_2O$) which has two dipole moments which form a permanent dipole moment with Hydrogen atoms becoming the positive pole & Oxygen Atom becoming the negative pole.

A molecule must showcase a temporary change in dipole moment during at least one of its vibrations modes to be called IR Active.
