# Shunga Dynasty
> Dynasty established by a Brahmin named [[Pushyamitra Shunga\|Pushyamitra Shunga]] to mainstream & revive [[Hinduism\|Hinduism]] before it is eaten up by mass-conversions to [[Bauddha Philosophy (Buddhism)\|Buddhism]].

The Shungas controlled the Northern Gangetic Plains and parts of Malwa & Central India until the shores of Narmada. After the death of [[Agnimitra Shunga\|Agnimitra Shunga]], the empire started to fracture & lost control over Central India.

### Formation
[[Pushyamitra Shunga\|Pushyamitra Shunga]] as a Brahmin was worried about how [[Hinduism\|Hinduism]] is threatened & temples are destroyed freely under the [[Mauryan Empire\|Mauryan Empire]] (especially under [[Ashoka\|Ashoka]]) since none of the people that sit on the throne are devout hindus. For Hindu Revival, change had to come from the top & to reach the top, he publically assassinated the 9th Emperor of Mauryan Empire, Brihadratha Maurya.

### Major Emperors
[[Pushyamitra Shunga\|Pushyamitra Shunga]] (185 BC to 151 BC)
[[Agnimitra Shunga\|Agnimitra Shunga]] (151 BC to 141 BC)
[[Vasujyeshta Shunga\|Vasujyeshta Shunga]] (141 BC to 131 BC)
[[Vasumitra Shunga\|Vasumitra Shunga]] (131 BC to 124 BC)
[[Bhāgabhadra Shunga\|Bhāgabhadra Shunga]] (114 BC to 83 BC) also called "Bhadraka"
[[Devabhuti Shunga\|Devabhuti Shunga]] (83 BC to 75 BC) - also called "Devabhomi Shunga".

### Literary Mentions
The legendary [[Sanskrit\|Sanskrit]] poet & playwright [[Kālidāsa\|Kālidāsa]] wrote a play on the love affair between [[Agnimitra Shunga\|Agnimitra Shunga]] along with a woman named [[Mālvika\|Mālvika]] named "[[Mālvikāgnimitram\|Mālvikāgnimitram]]" which is an concatenation of both the names.

[[Pushyamitra Shunga\|Pushyamitra Shunga]] and the [[Shunga Dynasty\|Shunga Dynasty]] seem to be called as Hindu Supremacists by many based on the [[Bauddha Philosophy (Buddhism)\|Buddhist]] texts [[Deepvamsha\|Deepvamsha]] & [[Mahavamsha\|Mahavamsha]] which claimed that Shungas persecuted many Buddhists and destroyed [[Stūpa\|Stūpas]] but many historians say these may be exaggerated if not blatantly untrue because Ashokan-era Stupas were repaired by Pushyamitra - which is why they have survived till today (including the [[Sānchī Stūpa\|Sānchī Stūpa]]). It seems that for Pushymitra, Hindu revival was more important than damaging Buddhism.

### Cultural Contributions
[[Heliodorus Inscriptions of Besnagar\|Heliodorus Inscriptions of Besnagar]] were erected sometime around 150 BC during the reign of [[Bhāgabhadra Shunga\|Bhāgabhadra Shunga]] & mentions him as "Bhāgabhadra the saviour". Writings suggest that [[Heliodorus\|Heliodorus]] (the man who made the pillar inscriptions) was sent to Magadha by [[Yavana Confederacy\|Yavana]] ruler named [[Antialcidas Nikephoros\|Antialcidas Nikephoros]].

### Decline
[[Devabhuti Shunga\|Devabhuti Shunga]] was overtly interested in women and was overall a good-for-nothing lazy dude who is clearly not fit to be the Emperor. He was assassinated by his minister collaborating with one of his female servants (disguised as the empress) while Devabhuti was drunk. This is when his minister [[Vasudeva Kanva\|Vasudeva Kanva]] made the killing move and established the [[Kanvavamsha Dynasty\|Kanvavamsha Dynasty]]. This entire event is documented by medieval era poet [[Banabhatta\|Banabhatta]] in his autobiography of [[Harshavardhan\|Harshavardhan]] named as "[[Harshacharita\|Harshacharita]]". Harsha was from the [[Pushyabhuti Dynasty\|Pushyabhuti Dynasty]].
