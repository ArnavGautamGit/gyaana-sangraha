# Endowment Effect
> Tendency of the seller to attach extra emotional value to the item being sold.

It is very common in Real Estate and selling houses. People feel that others should pay the premium and sticking to the market price is undervaluing their property. Although the effect is not limited to Real Estate and Housing Finance, it is most commonly observable in that industry.

### Avoidance
Don't cling to things and sell items after thoroughly examining the average market price and price your item at THAT average market price.
