# Aldric Wisdomkeeper (Greyhawk) - D&D Charater
Character I made for the [[Greyhawk Lives!\|Greyhawk Lives!]] Discord [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/D&D Compendium/Dungeons & Dragons\|D&D]] server
It is a [[Wizard (D&D)\|Wizard (D&D)]] and he passed on his 3rd adventure of all-time.
The Character was remade as [[Aldric Wisdomkeeper (DH)\|Aldric Wisdomkeeper (DH)]] to be played in some Daggerheart setting of my choice.

Following is the note I wrote in my Character Logs Thread in the server:
> *Character Dies in a heroic & final full-circle moment with the episode starting with first attack being Aldric's "Burning Hands" spell and ends in Aldric being burnt in the flames of a Ballista which itself gets burnt down in the warehouse set ablaze by the surviving party*

### What I learnt from this character
1. Improve your AC
2. Always use your movement
3. Remember the Characters that have been with Aldric and [[Greyhawk Lives!#^1\|execute the plan]].
