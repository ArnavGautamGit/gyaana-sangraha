# Economic Social Council (ECOSOC)
> It is one of the six [[United Nations (U.N)#Principal Organs\|Principal Organs of the United Nations]] which is headquartered in New York, USA. It is the body which looks after the Economic and Social Upliftment of poorer states & promotes international economic and social cooperation and development.

It has many subsidiary organisations for increasing cooperation in following sectors relating to economic and societal well-being:
1. Health - via the [[World Health Organisation (W.H.O)\|World Health Organisation (W.H.O)]]
2. Education - via [[UNESCO\|UNESCO]]
3. Labour - via the [[International Labour Organisation (I.L.O)\|International Labour Organisation (I.L.O)]]
4. Development - via the [[United Nations Development Program (U.N.D.P)\|United Nations Development Program (U.N.D.P)]]
5. Human Rights - via the [[Human Rights Council\|Human Rights Council]]

All of these organisation report to ECOSOC at some level or another but certain organisations have developed some autonomy in their sectors.

### Purpose
- Increase cooperation between [[State (United Nations)\|UN Member States]] on matters pertaining to Economic and Societal well-being.
- Conducting research, issuing reports and making policy recommendations on global economic, social and environmental issues.
- Facilitating dialogue between governments and [[Non-Government Organisations (NGOs)\|Non-Government Organisations (NGOs)]].
- Organising High Level Forums & agendas like the [[High-Level Political Forum (HLPF)\|High-Level Political Forum (HLPF)]] to monitor progress made towards achieving the [[Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)\|Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)]] set by the [[United Nations (U.N)\|United Nations (U.N)]] in stipulated time.

### Structure
It has 54 [[State (United Nations)\|Member States]] who get elected by the [[United Nations General Assembly (U.N.G.A)\|United Nations General Assembly (U.N.G.A)]] for 3 year term (with regional quotas from each continent). The Council decides by Majority Vote. It oversees many commissions & committees like:
- [[Commission on Status of Women (CSW)\|Commission on Status of Women (CSW)]] (Men can go & die i guess)
- [[Commission on Narcotic Drugs\|Commission on Narcotic Drugs]]
- [[Statistical Commission\|Statistical Commission]]
- [[Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues\|Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues]]

### Weaknesses
The resolutions passed here are not legally binding like the [[United Nations Security Council (U.N.S.C)\|UN Security Council]] but it plays an advisory role. We all know how "seriously" states take advisory from the UN because righteous people are the first to be sidelined in Politics (like Ned Stark in Game of Thrones) and the UN is the righteous body at the centre of Global Politics!
