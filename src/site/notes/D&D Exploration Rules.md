# D&D Exploration Rules
> Rules for [[Compendiums/D&D Compendium/Dungeons & Dragons\|D&D]] for tasks related to Exploration of the game setting and unseeen locations in said games.

Exploration involves delving into places that are dangerous and full of mystery. The rules in this section detail some of the ways adventurers interact with the environment in such places.

## Adventuring Equipment
As adventurers explore, their equipment can help them in many ways. For example, they can reach out-of-the-way places with a Ladder, perceive things they wouldn't otherwise notice with a Torch or another light source, bypass locked doors and con tainers with Thieves'Tools, and create obstacles for pursuers with Caltrops.

Rely on D&D Beyond for the Starting Equipment and Gear unless mentioned in another such note which will be linked here: [[D&D Adventuring Equipment, Tools & Gear\|D&D Adventuring Equipment, Tools & Gear]]

## Vision & Light
An area might be Lightly or Heavily Obscured. In a Lightly Obscured area-such as an area with Dim Light, patchy fog, or moderate foliage-you have Disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight. A Heavily Obscured area-such as an area with Darkness, heavy fog, or dense foliage-is opaque. You have the Blinded condition (see the rules glossary) when trying to see something there

The presence or absence of light determines the category of illumination in an area, as defined below. 
- ***Bright Light***: lets most creatures see normally. Even gloomy days provide Bright Light, as do torches, lanterns, fires, and other sources of illumination within a specific radius. 
- ***Dim Light***: also called shadows, creates a Lightly Obscured area. An area of Dim Light is usually a boundary between Bright Light and surrounding Darkness. The soft light of twilight and dawn also counts as Dim Light. A full moon might bathe the land in Dim Light.
- ***Darkness***: creates a Heavily Obscured area. Characters face Darkness outdoors at night (even most moonlit nights), within the confines of an unlit dungeon, or in an area of magical Darkness.

The players may be able to see in Darkness if they are equipped with a Special Sense like [[Blindsight\|Blindsight]], [[Darkvision\|Darkvision]], [[Tremorsense\|Tremorsense]] or [[Truesight\|Truesight]].

### Hiding
Adventurers and monsters often hide, whether to spy on one another, sneak past a guard or set an ambush. The [[Dungeon Master (DM)\|DM]] decides when circumstances are appropriate for hiding. When you try to hide, you take the Hide action.

### Interacting with Objects
Objects in D&D are defined as discrete, inanimate items such as a door, lock, sword, envelope etc. Some interactions might be limited by time such as in combat (one free interaction per turn during a creature's movement or action. Any additional interactions require the Utilize action, as explained in [[D&D Combat Rules\|D&D Combat Rules]].

Other types of interactions often includes finding hidden objects in a scene or location.
When your character searches for hidden things, such as a secret door or a trap, the [[Dungeon Master (DM)\|DM]] typically asks you to make a Wisdom (Perception) check, provided you describe the character searching in the hidden object's vicinity. On a success, you find the object, other important details, or both. Ifyou describe your character searching nowhere near a hidden object, a Wisdom (Perception) check won't reveal the object, no matter the check's total even if it is a critical roll (natural 20).

### Travel Pace
Pace at which travel occurs (not a hard rule, but a guideline).
It is recommended that players have a marching order (who is walking ahead) so we instantly know who to ask if the [[Dungeon Master (DM)\|Dungeon Master (DM)]] needs to check if any character triggers a trap since it is convenient for the DM to know who is leading the march. Often the DM would just ask a particular player which is also fine but in narrow dungeons it is best to keep a tanky character in front and a tanky one in the back.

Below are the given numbers on page 23 of the [[Compendiums/D&D Compendium/Corebooks/D&D Player's Handbook\|D&D PHB]] for movement on foot. These numbers are doubled if you are moving on a mount such as a horse although it needs to be noted that mounts would need to take a long or short rest after each hour of travel (that is after each stretch of 4-8 miles).

Travelers in wagons, carriages, or other land vehicles choose a pace as normal. Characters in a water borne vessel are limited to the speed of the vessel, and they don't choose a travel pace. Depending on the vessel and the size of the crew, ships might be able to travel for upto 24 hours per day.
