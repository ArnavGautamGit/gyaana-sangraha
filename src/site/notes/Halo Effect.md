# Halo Effect
> An effect where a single good/evil quality of a person or entity produces a positive/negative impression that skews the overall perception.

When the "single quality" is beauty - we see [[Pretty Priviledge\|Pretty Priviledge]] and this effect is also responsible for the saying that "The First Impression is the Last Impression"

This also manifests with the [[Liking Bias\|Liking Bias]] for it being normalised that there is no problem with celebrities like Roger Federer in promoting Mercedes cars in their advertisements since the Liking Bias will make people want to buy that specific model of the Mercedes lineup. We must also avoid the Halo Effect to be empowered by [[Confirmation Bias\|Confirmation Bias]]

Halo Effect is also responsible for birthing racism and hatred if the sole attribute is negative. Early Christians only using the physical colour of the people's skin to determine if they are "worthy" to sit with them is very much rooted here. ([[Halo Effect#^1\|#^1]])

### Avoidance
Go beyond face value. Factor out the most striking features. World-class Orchestras achieve this by making candidates play behind a screen, so that sex, race, age and appearance play no part in decision making.
