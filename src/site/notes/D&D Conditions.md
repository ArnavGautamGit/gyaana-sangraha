# D&D Conditions
> Specific conditions that any creature can get into for a set duration until something happens or not.

These are all the conditions:
- Blinded Condition
- Charmed Condition
- Deafened Condition
- Exhaustion
- Frightened Condition
- Grappled Condition
- Hidden (D&D)
- Invisible Condition
- Incapacitated Condition
- Paralyzed Condition
- Petrified
- Poisioned
- Prone
- Restrained
- Shunned
- Unconscious Condition

None of the conditions can be indefinite.
A condition lasts either for a duration specified by the effect that imposed the condition or until the condition is countered (the Prone condition is coun tered by standing up, for example).

If multiple effects impose the same condition on you, each instance of the condition has its own duration, but the condition's effects don't get worse. Either you have a condition or you don't. The Exhaustion condition is an exception; its effects get worse if you have the condition and receive it again.
