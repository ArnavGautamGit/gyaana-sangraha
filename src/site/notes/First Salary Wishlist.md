# First Salary Wishlist
> Everyone is happy about their first salary, it is a sign of going on the right path towards financial independence and everyone has their own list of what they would like to buy.

The Financially literate would buy a health insurance or life insurance or both.
I would not do that since I already have both of them covered for myself.
This note is connected to [[My Wishlist of Success\|My Wishlist of Success]].

I would like to buy the following:
- Formal Shoes
- Custom Wax Seal
- PS4 Controller Repair
- Save up for a PS5
- Save up for an iPhone
