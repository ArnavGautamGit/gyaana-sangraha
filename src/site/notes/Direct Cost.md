# Direct Cost
> Costs that can be attributed to the manufacturing of any good or object in a Business.
> Example: Cost of raw materials, manufacturing machines and electricity spent on manufacturing that good by running said machines or other operations.

It is also called Variable Costs since these costs are often variable & keep increasing with time.
It is rare to see the costs decrease unless the entire market is in a slump i.e., consumer demand is extremely low and there is a lot of stock left to sell so businesses have slowed production.

When Direct Cost is added with [[Indirect Cost\|Indirect Cost]], it gives us the [[Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)\|Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)]].

$$\Large\text{Direct Cost} + \text{Indirect Cost} = \text{Cost of Goods Sold}$$
