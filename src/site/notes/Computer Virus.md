# Computer Virus
Virus is a type of malware named after biological viruses since they share the same tendency of [[Exponential Growth\|Geometric Growth]] by attaching itself to a file and replicating. This process generally destroys the healthy program it attaches to, or coexists with it by appending itself to it. The procedure of a Virus attaching itself to a healthy program is known as [[Viral Appending\|Viral Appending]].

Viruses can be detected and destroyed (if not prevented) by [[Anti-Virus Software\|Anti-Virus Software]]

### Virus Activity Phases
Each Virus operates in the following phases (classified on the basis of Activity):
1. ==***Dormant Phase***==: Idle, Waiting for the right conditions to be met. Which is utilised extensively for successful uses of many [Logic Bombs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_bomb) that have worked.
2. ==***Propagation Phase***==: Virus puts a copy of itself into other programs or specific system area on the disk. Copy need not be identical, morphs to avoid detection.
3. ==***Trigger Phase***==: The phase when the virus gets executed. Contains a user-action like pressing of a button, or clicking on the exe file to start the program.
4. ==***Execution Phase***==: Virus executes the payload in this phase.
