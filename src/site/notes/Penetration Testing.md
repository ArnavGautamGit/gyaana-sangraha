# Penetration Testing
> A process to simulate either a full [[Hacking\|hacking]] attack on the system or one of its [[Phases of Hacking\|phases]] and try to break in, to test and prove the effectiveness of the System's Security.

It involves a CyberSec expert (either the [[White-Hat Hackers\|White-Hat Hackers]] or [[Red-Hat Hackers\|Red-Hat Hackers]]) review and perform a "security audit" of the system & generating a report that details the findings and changes (if needed) that must be implemented to better safeguard the system against attackers.

### Benefits / Advantages
1. Visibility and Documentations of any Vulnerabilities
2. Knowledge of threats - the threat type and the assets it will try to hit
3. Faster and Cheaper than [[Vulnerability Research\|Vulnerability Research]], helps in quick security improvement.
4. Verifies all Security Measures are working and increases the morale and confidence of security professionals and developers who worked on the project.

### PenTesting Frequency
After the initial pre-launch PenTesting is done and the app is launched for the public to use, we only perform successive PenTests if at least one the following given situations is true:
- Network Infrastructure or Apps are added
- New Security Patches.
- Upgrades to existing infrastructure or apps
- New Office Locations are added
- End User License Agreement (EULA) is ammended.
