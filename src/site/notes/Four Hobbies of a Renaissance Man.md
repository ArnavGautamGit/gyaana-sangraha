# Four Hobbies of a Renaissance Man
> Concept introduced to me by a Youtuber known as Odysseas ([[Four Hobbies of a Renaissance Man#^1\|#^1]]) who explained why having multiple hobbies is important & how it helps different spheres of our brain to develop.

Odysseas argues that instead of dividing individual hobbies, we should be dividing them after categorising them on an individual basis (where we think they fit since hobbies are wide and numerous and detailed description for each hobby isn't possible.

Odysseas describes the following four categories of Hobbies:
1. Social - Where one can socialise
2. Physical - For Physical Health and Fitness (includes Gym)
3. Mental - For Mental Activity, Stimulation and Health
4. Artistic - For when one is alone and needs to have their creativity unleash.

## Extra Notes from Pocket Notebook
> Categories cannot overlap but you can have multiple hobbies in the same category. To truly become a renaissance man, it is recommmend to have at least one in each category!

> I have one social hobby (i.e., [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/D&D Compendium/Dungeons & Dragons\|Dungeons & Dragons]]) but I barely have time to follow it. I have two mental hobbies - Reading [[Books\|Books]] and Playing [[Compendiums/Chess Compendium/Chess\|Chess]]. I am not following any artistic hobby but have many contenders: [[Film Photography\|Film Photography]], [[Music Composition\|Music Composition]], [[Sketching\|Sketching]], [[Bookmark Painting\|Bookmark Painting]] and even coding! I am still missing a Physical Hobby - although I can take either Football or Gym. 

Note: Coding here could be in any language: [[Python\|Python]], [[JavaScript\|JavaScript]], [[React Native\|React Native]] etc.

### Personal Hobby Spread
Among the Social Category, I have the following hobbies that can be placed in the "Social" Category: 
- [[Dialectic\|Dialectic]] - engaging in reasoned argumentation or dialogue to explore ideas in depth.
- Playing any [[Table-Top Role-Playing Game\|Table-Top Role-Playing Game]] such as [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/D&D Compendium/Dungeons & Dragons\|D&D]] or [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/Daggerheart\|Daggerheart]] although drawing art for the same may be classified as Artistic.

On the other hand, for Mental Hobbies, I can either read [[Books\|Books]] or play [[Compendiums/Chess Compendium/Chess\|Chess]].
Physical Hobbies include: [[Exercise\|Exercise]] and [[Football\|Football]].

There are many contenders for an Artistic Hobby:
- [[Film Photography\|Film Photography]] - taking photos in 35mm or other formats of Camera Film instead of Digital Images.
- [[Music Composition\|Music Composition]] - trying to use FL Studio 20 or Waveform 12 to try and compose music.
- [[Sketching\|Sketching]] - Drawing characters for [[Table-Top Role-Playing Game\|TTRPGs]] or maybe just because I am bored.
- I may learn a new Musical Instrument or practice [[Bookmark Painting\|Bookmark Painting]]. I may sell the bookmarks and art at [[Comic Con Delhi 2025\|Comic Con Delhi 2025]].
- I may also code a new Software Solution to [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/Daggerheart\|Daggerheart]] being not supported much right now or any other problem I spot that I can fix.
