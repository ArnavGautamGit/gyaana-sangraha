# China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC)
> Economic Corridor built by China which goes through [[Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir (PoK)\|Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir (PoK)]] and terminates at the Gwadar Port. It is a well-known as a part of Chinese [[Debt-Trap Diplomacy\|Debt-Trap Diplomacy]] under the guise of its [[Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)\|Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)]].

The CPEC initiative contains a ML-1 train line between Peshawar & Karachi which costed a massive $10 Billion USD. It contains a massive multi-lane highway from POK to Gwadar. Gwadar Port itself is included in the deal.

All of this was said to bring trade & skyrocket the exports of Pakistan. Pakistanis took many short-term loans of interest rates as high as 4% to 6% per annum. This is the kind of interests Indians RECEIVE from banks on money kept in Savings Bank Accounts & [[Fixed Deposits (FDs)\|Fixed Deposits (FDs)]]. {source: [[China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC)#^1\|1]]}

Pakistanis forgot that exports cannot increase if the quality of the product being exported does not get better. Whatever Pakistan exports must have a unique demand for itself. Pakistan is already an economically sensitive [[State (United Nations)\|UN Member State]] which has a lot of debt.  

The result? Chinese now control the CPEC and Gwadar Port.
According to a 2022 Report by the [[International Monetary Fund (IMF)\|International Monetary Fund (IMF)]], China holds a massive 30% share in Pakistan's total Foreign Debt

### My Views
It seems it was never in China's plan to aid Pakistan, rather it was in China's plans to create an alternative to the [[Strait of Malacca\|Strait of Malacca]] - countering India's move of building Navy & Air Force bases in the [[Andaman & Nicobar Islands\|Andaman & Nicobar Islands]] in its attempt to utilise the chokepoint.
