# DaggerSoul Project - Discord Bot & Mobile App
> A Discord Bot and Mobile App for whether you are playing [[Compendiums/Daggerheart Compendium/Daggerheart\|Daggerheart]] online or offline on a table! DaggerSoul is there to help you!

Combines my itch for Gaming and Entrepreneurship via Programming. 
Its like a 2-in-1 itch reduction!

Hopefully, one day as the product expands, Critical Role themselves may buy this off.

Here are all the versions I have built for the Discord Bot - [[DaggerSoul Discord Bot\|DaggerSoul Discord Bot]]
Here are all the versions I have built for the App - [[DaggerSoul Mobile App\|DaggerSoul Mobile App]]
