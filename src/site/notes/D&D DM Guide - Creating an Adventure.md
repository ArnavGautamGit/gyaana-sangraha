# D&D DM Guide - Creating an Adventure
> An Adventure,also known as a campaign is a story told by the [[Dungeon Master (DM)\|Dungeon Master (DM)]] and other Players together in a [[Table-Top Role-Playing Game\|Table-Top Role-Playing Game]]. In a Game other than [[Dungeons & Dragons\|D&D]], a [[Dungeon Master (DM)\|Dungeon Master (DM)]] is often called as a [[Game Master (GM)\|Game Master (GM)]].

This note although based on the "Dungeon Master's Guide" published by the creators of [[Dungeons & Dragons\|D&D]], also works for any other [[Table-Top Role-Playing Game\|TTRPG]] like [[Daggerheart\|Daggerheart]] as well.

### Process of Creation
We must start with a [[Framing Event\|Framing Event]] which would frame the adventure's mood and set the story's pace, setting and general [[Exposition\|Exposition]]. Then figure out the type of the Adventure which will be based on the type of [[Conflict\|Conflict]]. If the adventure is an [[Event-based Adventure\|Event-based Adventure]], the main event responsible in shaping the adventure can occur here in this Event. If it is a [[Location-based Adventure\|Location-based Adventure]], then the party can be hired by the people in-charge of the location at this event. Although Event-based Adventures can start from the Framing Event, Location-based ones need a bit of buildup before the party reaches the event. 

> ***Note***: the adventure need not follow the exact order as prescribed in it, but must contain everything to form a coherent [[Storytelling Structure\|Storytelling Structure]].

Then, every story needs an [[Antagonist\|Antagonist]] who will act in villainy - often putting the parties in [[Quandaries\|Quandaries]]. Also consider a [[Safe House\|Safe House]] for the Players where the players can return and plan their next move.

Steer the party in the right direction (if needed) and force them to act a certain way with the use of [[RPG Encounters\|RPG Encounters]].
