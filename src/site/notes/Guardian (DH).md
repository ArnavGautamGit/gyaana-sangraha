# Guardian (DH)
> A [[DH Character Creation#Character Class\|Character Class]] of powerful infantry soldiers or mercenaries who can change the tide of the battle. Some of their features may look similar to some other classes in other [[Table-Top Role-Playing Game\|TTRPGs]] but they are unique to [[Daggerheart\|Daggerheart]].

Guardian love to be on the front-line and absorb damage.
Melee is their forte but they may hit from afar - generally they still do not like someone else other than a [[Warrior (DH)\|Warrior (DH)]] or fellow [[Guardian (DH)\|Guardian (DH)]] being in the frontlines of battle for various reasons - the biggest one being that they won't be able to absorb as much damage & Guardians cannot heal.

Prioritise [[Strength\|Strength]] and [[Agility\|Agility]] for a Brutal Guardian or [[Finesse\|Finesse]] can be added in the list to make a skilled Guardian from a great background.

### Domains
Domains of a class decide the Domain Cards (and abilities) one gets to pick up.
Each Class has 2 fixed Domains.
The Guardian's domains are: [[Valor\|Valor]] and [[Blade\|Blade]].

### Base Scores
Base [[Evasion Score\|Evasion Score]]: 8
Major Damage Threshold: 8
Severe Damage Threshold: 16

### Class Items
Each Class has a specific item they choose which will be a plot point in the story. They must choose one of the options.
For a Guardian, choose EITHER *"Your Master's Stone Totem"* OR *"A Secret Key"*

### Guardian's Hope - Special Ability
Guardian can spend 3x [[Hope Token\|Hope Token]] to clear 3x [[Armour Slots\|Armour Slots]].

### Class Feature - Unstoppable
Once per Long Rest, the Guardian can choose to become unstoppable and gain an extra dice (starting at d4). Count the number of turns on your Unstoppable dice where the Guardian has dealt damage of 1 or more [[Hit Point Slots\|HP Slot]]. When the count exceeds the largest number on your dice, you drop the Unstoppable Feature and remove the dice.

While Unstoppable, you gain the following:
- Resistance to Physical Damage
- Increase Armour Score by [[Proficiency Level\|Proficiency Level]]
- Add the number of turn to attack role i.e., if it is the third roll when the damage has been dealt, then on the fourth roll for attack, you can add 3 to it (previous turn was the 3rd turn)
- Immunity to being [[Restrained State (DH)\|Restrained]] or [[Vulnerable State (DH)\|Vulnerable]].


### Class Foundations (Subclasses)
There are two subclasses of Guardian suited to two major styles of play.
Stalwart allows you to tank attacks while Vengeance allows you to deal higher damage.
Personal recommendation is to take Vengeance since you can already regain [[Armour Slots\|Armour Slots]] and tank more using [[Guardian (DH)#Guardian's Hope - Special Ability\|Guardian's Hope]] discussed above.
- ***==Stalwart==*** allows players to be a frontline tank unit who takes and sucks up all the damage that the enemies do.
	- ***Foundation Feature***
		- Increase both Damage Thresholds by +1 (on top of [[Guardian (DH)#Base Scores\|Base Scores]])
	- ***Specialisation Feature***
		- Increase both Damage Thresholds by +2
		- When an ally in Very Close Range takes damage, you can reduce it by expending a maximum of 1 [[Armour Slots\|Armour Slots]] of your own. Your [[Armour Score\|Armour Score]] will be used.
	- ***Mastery Feature***
		- Increase both Damage Thresholds by +3
		- When an ally within Close range has 2 Hit Points or fewer and should take damage, you can immediately mark a Stress to sprint to their side and take the damage instead.
- ***==Vengeance==*** allows the player to play the frontline damage dealer who absolutely deletes any enemy standing before them.
	- ***Foundation Feature***
		- Increase [[Armour Slots\|Armour Slots]] by +1
		- When an enemy hits you in Melee range, roll a number of d6 dice equal to the number of [[Hit Point Slots\|Hit Point Slots]] you lost. For every roll of 5 & above, deal 1 [[Hit Point Slots\|HP Slot]] back to enemy.
	- ***Specialisation Feature***
		- When an enemy damages an ally in melee range of the Guardian, and the Guardian's attack roll on that enemy beats the Enemy's [[Evasion Score\|Evasion Score]], then the Guardian attacks with +1 [[Proficiency Level\|Proficiency Level]] for that attack.
	- ***Mastery Feature***
		- Guardian can prioritise one enemy at a time.
		- Spend 2x [[Hope Token\|Hope Token]] to prioritize ONE enemy until your next rest. When you make an Attack Roll against your prioritized enemy, you can switch the values on your Hope and Fear dice.
