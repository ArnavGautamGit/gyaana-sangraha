# Football Clubs
> Regional Teams organised into business firms comprising of players, coaches, staff and management responsible for organised [[Football\|Football]] in domestic and regional leagues. 

Most Football Clubs are small, with barely any assets apart from staff & players. Many clubs never get rich enough to get their own stadiums and rent those built by the government. Vast majority of the clubs are hereby called "Hobby-ist" or "Recreational" or "Amateur" Clubs.
Only a few of the richest clubs are able to get to the sheer size which allows them to build their own stadiums. 

### Average Owners
Often people who start clubs are rich themselves due to other businesses or land that they can devote to the cultivation of the sport - used for the tryouts and practice for matches.
Many owners own other businesses that are mush more stable and less [[Capital\|Capital]]-Intensive.

For Example: Ranjit Bajaj has a Football Club and a Cricket Club both spawned out of the Minerva Punjab Academy (which prepares teens and young adults for army recruitment) which is an evergreen business and both the teams act as an outlet of fitness for a slew of youngsters - the only major [[Asset\|Asset]] he would never run out of.
