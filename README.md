# Digitised Obsidian Notes
All my notes I made on Obsidian made public (except personal ones) so that I can learn in Public.
It was essentially to practice EleventyJS and SCSS until I realised Eleventy is not useful for dynamic websites.
This documents my life's learnings from 2024 onwards - so anything before 5th sem of my Btech degree is not here unless added later in retrospect/hindsight.
