# Movies & TV Shows
> A list or Catalogue of movies I have watched along with those that I own Physically or Digitally either as physical DVDs, Bluray Discs or even MP4s ripped from Bluray

I personally love Blurays more than other mediums but alas, it is not a widely adopted medium in India as new content goes straight to Streaming Services (often called OTT in India).

> Any note added to the table or any note in the table does not provide a link to watch said content online, it only provides a personal review of the material. Any links to pirated copies are not endorsed even if present by chance or for the purposes of providing context to the users.

## Owned Movies
In the following table, DVDs that my dad bought for me during his business visit to China are labelled separately as "Chinese DVD" instead of just DVD. This is also because I suspect they might be some counterfeit/bootleg discs and not originals.
