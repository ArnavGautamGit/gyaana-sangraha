# Classification of Cyber Threats
> Defines the different Classes of Threats to any Computer System or Network that is accessible or connected to the Internet.

There are 4 main classes of Threats:
1. **==Interception==**: Some Unautorised Party gains access to an asset. The outside party can be a person, a program, or a computiing system. Examples: Illicit copying of a program or data-files. Although a loss may be discovered fairly quickly, a silent interceptor may leave no traces by which the interception could be readily detected.
2. **==Interruption==**: An event when an asset becomes lost, or unavailable or unusable. For Example: malicious destruction of a hardware device, erasure of a program or a data file.
3. **==Modification==**: Unauthorised party not only gains access to asset, but also tampers with the said asset. For Example: Someone might change the values in a database or alter a program to perform additional computation etc.
4. **==Fabrication==**: Unauthorised Party creates a counterfeit. Sometimes, these addtitions can be detected as forgery, but if skillfully performed, they are indistinguishable from the originals.
