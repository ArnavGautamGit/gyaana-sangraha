# Lurovian Calendar
> Also called "Scar Lake Calendar", it is the calendar used across the entirety of [[Lurov\|Lurov]] while some may see or have created some regional calendars of their own.

It is read as "Year SLC" where SLC stands for "Since Lake Creation" referring to [[Scar Lake\|Scar Lake]] and its surrounding [[Scar Lake Forest\|Scar Lake Forest]] which was created by a comet crashing into the ground. The comet is considered the source of all magic & the Elves consider to have descended from it by DNA being brought from space.

The Magic has said to have introduced the planet with Faun, Firbolg, Simiah among other humanoid DNA.
