# Balance Of Power
> A Concept in [[International Studies\|International Studies]] which says that all States in the World seek to protect themselves and they will try to equalise in terms of [[National Power\|National Power]] with the threatening State so that in the time of provocation or war, the damage on both sides are equal.

It is a concept born from [[Realism\|Realist]] and [[Neo-Realism\|Neo-Realist]] Philosophies since the states are trying to prepare for the worst case scenario. There may be cases when the threat is genuine or maybe the threat is preemptive at times.

A lot of times, States seeking Balance of Power against a State or group of States create Alliances with other States who are similarly threatened or have common [[National Interest\|National Interest]]. 

Example: [[North Atlantic Trade Organisation (NATO)\|North Atlantic Trade Organisation (NATO)]] was made to counter Russia by creating a military & economic coalition where the States that felt threatened by the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR)\|Soviet Union]] came together to form an allaince where under Article 5, any attack on any one state is considered as an attack on all member states. Similarly, [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR)\|USSR]] was able to unite the States on its side in an alliance governed by the [[Warsaw Pact\|Warsaw Pact]].
