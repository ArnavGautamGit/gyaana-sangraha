# Product Ciphers
> [[Cryptographic Encryption Algorithms\|Cryptographic Encryption Algorithms]] which combine [[Substitution-based Ciphers\|Substitution-based Ciphers]] with [[Transposition-based Ciphers\|Transposition-based Ciphers]]. Product Ciphers are considered the best among both the other types (Substitution-only or Transposition-only) because it combines the strength of both.

If the process of Substitution and Transposition in any of the [[Product Ciphers\|Product Ciphers]] is repeated in a deteministic pattern it is called as an [[Iterative Product Cipher\|Iterative Product Cipher]].
