# Tailwind
> A phenomenon where the direction of the flying aircraft is the same as the wind, i.e., wind approaches from the tail side and hits the tail first.

It is considered extremely unsafe to land or takeoff in tailwinds - primarily since aircraft lift properties and the wings are designed for cutting through air but if wind is coming from behind the wings, it creates interference and unpredictable movements.
