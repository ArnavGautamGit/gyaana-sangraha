# Hara Hachi Bun me (Japanese Concept)
> A Japanese Concept that describes eating until we are 80% full and then stopping at that point. It is written as 腹八分目 in Japanese Kanji script.

It is also called as "80% rule" and "Hara Hachi Bu" in the book "[[Ikigai - The Japanese Secret to a Long and Happy Life\|Ikigai - The Japanese Secret to a Long and Happy Life]]" by Hector Gargia and Fracesc Miralles. 

Although the Japanese YouTuber Matcha Samurai calls this rule as "Hara Hachibunme" - so I will trust him more than a pair of European Tourists who interviewed a bunch of old people in Japan. According to his translation, "Hara Hachi Bun Me" means "80% of your stomach" - maybe more descriptive than just "Hara Hachi Bu"?  Wikipedia says both are fine.

### The Need / Reasoning
It is widely noted that once we stuff ourself to the brim, we are less active and feel lathargic. To live a healthier lifestyle, we need to live a more active life and stuffing ourselves with food everytime we sit down to eat is a hinderance to the goal.

### Implementation
- The Japanese serve food in multiple small plates kept in a tray.
- The Idea is to eat only healthy food that contributes nutritionally and not junk food.
- When you feel like you are starting to get full, stop eating.

### Origins
Wikipedia claims that this is related to [[Confucianism\|Confucianism]].
It is a part of the full Japanese Proverb: "腹八分に病なし、腹十二分に医者足らず". 
This proverb literally translates to the following: "stomach 80% in, no illness, stomach 120% in, doctor shortage" which means that while eating to 80% of your stomach's capacity sustains the person, eating more than that sustains the doctors.
