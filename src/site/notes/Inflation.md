# Inflation
> A phenomenon where the prices of [[Goods\|Goods]] increase exponentially year-on-year. 
> It is also said "what Compounding creates, Inflation eats". 

Inflation is considered better than deflation for any economy - since it shows that the public's demand for goods is increasing. Too much inflation is also bad for the economy since the prices of [[Giffin Goods\|Staple Goods]] grow beyond the disposable income of a big section of people.

Once upon a time being a crorepati was rare, now it is getting a lot less rare because inflation along with [[Economic Growth\|Economic Growth]] has made the value of 1 Crore of 2025 a lot lower than 1 Crore of 1985.

Negative Inflation is called [[Economic Deflation\|Economic Deflation]].
Declining Inflation (as long as it is still positive) is called dis-inflation.

### Healthy Inflation Rate
Rate of increase in prices - as long as it is in 1-4% range is called "Creeping Inflation" while inflation rate of 5-8% is called Walking Inflation & 10-20% inflation rate is often referred to as a "Running Inflation" rate.

Creeping Inflation (1-4%) is considered healthy in any economy - it means that there is a healthy amount of [[Demand\|Demand]] from consumers that is driving up the price by consumption.
SEBI advises that Inflation should be $\large 4 \pm 2\%$ 

### Impact on Savings
Cost of Living rises and capacty of households to save money reduce. 
Interest Rates shoot up - cost of borrowing increases & credit becomes harder.
This makes businesses avoid loans and slow down expansion, in the short term the businesses may try to maximise profits by increasing supplies but eventually in the long run businesses avoid loans & the economy sees a slowdown. There might be either a reduction in inflation due to declining [[Demand\|Demand]] or completely go out of control into Hyperinflation!

### Impact on Cuurecy Value
Due to inflation, a currency's purchasing power falls & we can see the value of the currency take a fall on the international stage. This means that imports get more expensive as more of the domestic currency will be needed to buy the item. Exports get cheaper due to receiving more of the domestic currency for the same amount of work - assuming that all other factors stay constant.
