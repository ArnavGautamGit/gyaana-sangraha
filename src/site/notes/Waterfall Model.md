# Waterfall Model
> The First [[SDLC Models\|SDLC Model]] explicitly designed by scholars & Project Managers of 1950s to fix the problems encountered by the [[Build & Fix Model\|Build & Fix Model]] and actually get a vision of development instead of blinding building.

Became a standard by the mid-1950s, creation of the Waterfall Model was centred around the delays caused by showcasing the half-finished product to the stakeholders and repeatedly getting changes. The inherent problem was the person requesting a software solution is not computer literate and hence cannot explain the problem in a technical language and the requirements are not clear.

### Working
Waterfall starts with the step of ***Requirement Analysis*** where the requirements are first understood, then converted to technical lingo, confirmed and analysed. The Goal is to understand the requirements completely and perfectly so that nothing is missed or left over and the stakeholders do not have to explain themselves over and over.

The next step is that the Solution will be ***designed*** by the team working on the solution.
***Post-design, the software solution is modelled*** using [[Unified Modelling Language (UML)\|Unified Modelling Language (UML)]] and Flowcharts. This is also the stage when all the work is divided among the team.

The ***Implementation*** formally begins after the division of the work. This is also the stage where all the implementation is also ***tested***. Once the development team is satisfied, the solution is ***deployed and maintained*** according to any verbal or written contracts.

| ***PROS***                                                                                                      | ***CONS***                                                                                                  |

| The Processes used and Results obtained are very well documented. <br>Best for static project requirements.<br> | Changes cannot be accomodated at all. Since if Changes are introduced, we have to start over.               |
| Works best for projects are very well understood by the Client and explained with precision and accuracy.       | Real Projects are rarely this well documented or well understood (even by the Client) to execute this.      |
| Best for mission-critical systems or Megaprojects that need to be developed with minimum people                 | Client involvement and visibility is low. Client does not know what is happening until the project is done. |
| Best for Government Projects where secrecy is valued like DRDO & Ordinance Factory.                             | No Concurrently working on multiple phases means that development is slow.                                  |
| Easy to estimate cost and deadline.                                                                             | Does not work well for projects with dynamic requirements.                                                  |
