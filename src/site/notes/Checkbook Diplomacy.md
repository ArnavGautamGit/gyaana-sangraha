# Checkbook Diplomacy
> A way of [[Diplomacy\|Diplomacy]] where a [[State (United Nations)\|State]] with greater ability to fund projects pays high prices and loans to win the states over to their side so they have a greater support in international forums such as [[United Nations General Assembly (U.N.G.A)\|UNGA]] contributing to their [[Soft Power\|Soft Power]].

China is famous for using this tactic against smaller states which were able to pay back their [[Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)\|Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)]] loans so that there are more states voting in their favour.
This means China will not have to use their Veto as much & they would not look like the villains.

China makes [[China's Investment into Africa\|heavy investments into Africa]] so that they can promote their products and also buy votes in the [[United Nations General Assembly (U.N.G.A)\|United Nations General Assembly (U.N.G.A)]] & have to use the Veto less often.

It is to be noted however that whenevrer Chinese & Indian goods (such as Motorbikes) have come head-to-head, the people prefer the Indian Motorbikes a lot more.

### Other Examples
Not just China, Sheikhs of the Saudi Arabia and other oil-rich West Asian states have long used money and their control over one of the most expensive & sought after resources (Oil & Natural Gas) to get other states do their bidding.

Iran has also used its oil money to challenge Arab political dominance in the Middle East and extend its influence in Iraq, in Lebanon through [[Hezbollah\|Hezbollah]], and in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict through [[Hamas\|Hamas]]. In fact there is regular Shia vs Sunni tensions in the "Muslim Brotherhood" to see who outspends who to increase their influence in a particular part of the world or its economy.

In fact many of these West Asian States regularly use their oil money to empower & later purchase football teams & form massive football groups like the City Football Group - which has an extensive  roaster of Melbourne City FC, Mumbai City FC, Manchester City FC and New York City FC under their umbrella to name just a few. 

The U.S. has also pursued checkbook diplomacy to advance efforts to stop proliferation and secure regional peace arrangements. Via the [[Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction Program\|Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction Program]], the United States has provided billions of dollars to dismantle weapons of mass destruction and their associated infrastructure, and secure and dispose of nuclear material in the former states of the Soviet Union and forty other countries.

### Sometimes the Cheque Bounces
In the 1990s, for instance, the U.S. brokered an agreement giving North Korea $4 billion in energy aid and light-water reactors in exchange for freezing and dismantling its nuclear weapons program. The deal could not be sustained, however, and Pyongyang continues its nuclear weapons program today.

When the United States and Saudi Arabia bankrolled Afghanistan’s anti-Soviet jihad using the [[Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI)\|BCCI Bank]] in the 1980s, they gave little thought to the possibility that they could be funding and arming their future enemies as the Mujaheedin became the Taliban which later committed the [[9/11 Terrorist Attack\|9/11 Terrorist Attack]].
