# Clank
> A [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Ancestries/DH Species Ancestry\|DH Species Ancestry]] of Sentient Mechanical beings made for a specific purpose by some creator. They may be made out of metal, wood or a mixture of both.

All Clanks have a power source. They may or may not have humanoid features.
All clanks can self-repair to a certain degree but appendages may be broken beyond the level of self-repair.

On choosing Clank, you get the following Ancestry Features:
- ***Purposeful Design***: Write and keep a note of the purpose you were made for (i.e., the class you wish to play) and make the character design & one of the starting Experiences reflect the same.
- ***Efficient***: When you take a short rest, you are allowed to substitute a long rest move for a short rest move.

***Lifespan of an average Clank:*** $\large\infty$ (as long as parts are available/can be built) however the magic or source (or both) that powers them may deteriorate over time. Maybe parts can go out of production.
