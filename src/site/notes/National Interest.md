# National Interest
> A Concept describing any assets, goals, values and interest a [[State (United Nations)\|State]] may have & may wish to protect.

We learnt in the note [[State (United Nations)\|State (United Nations)]] where in the definition of a State we saw 4 main components. Fixed Population, Stable borders, the State's Government and Sovereignity are the four primary assets a State has. If any of these assets are attacked directly or indirectly, the threatened state is fully authorised to act & neutralise that threat since it has the guaranteed right of self defence as per the [[Charter of the United Nations (1945)\|Charter of the United Nations (1945)]].

Certain States do have assets in other States & assets can comprise of more things than the 4 aspects that collectively define a state. For Example: Indian-built Dams and Infrastructure in Afghanistan is still an asset of India. 

Are all assets and goals a part of National Interest? Not really. It depends on what assets a state wants to prioritise. It is a complex topic that is abstract and no one can truly understand what all it entails. 

### Methods of Protecting National Interest
Due to better documentation and discussion among learned people, we know what methods are used to safeguard National Interest since these methods are direct & commonly used.

1. ***Diplomacy*** ---> Preferred method of negotiation & arrival on a common ground.
2. ***Propaganada*** ---> Governments propping up an image of the justness of their goals.
3. ***Economic Means*** ---> Richer States arm-twist others by sanctions & economic isolation.
4. ***Alliances & Treaties*** ---> States with common interests ally with each other.
5. ***Coercive Measures*** ---> Intervention, Embargos, Boycotts and Severance of Relations are often used to tell other states to "walk the line" if they want to avoid the consequences.

### Classification of National Interest
Notes from Andrew Heyburn's Reference book will be updated on the day before the exam (don't remember the exact name of the author).
