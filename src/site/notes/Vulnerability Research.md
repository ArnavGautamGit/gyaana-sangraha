# Vulnerability Research
> Study & Research of [[Cyber Security Terminology#Vulnerabilities\|vulnerabilities]] that have never existed before (also known as [[Zero-Day Vulnerabilities\|Zero-Day Vulnerabilities]])

It involves systematically analyzing software, hardware, systems, or [[Computer Networks\|Networks]] to uncover previously unknown [[Zero-Day Vulnerabilities\|Zero-Day Vulnerabilities]]—flaws that haven't been publicly documented or patched. 

### Scope
Researchers employ advanced techniques such as reverse engineering, [[Fuzzing\|Fuzzing]] (inputting random data to trigger errors), code auditing, dynamic analysis, and binary exploitation to understand how components work and identify unexpected behaviors that could lead to unauthorized access, data leaks, or system compromise. The outcome often includes developing [[Proofs-of-Concept (PoCs)\|Proofs-of-Concept (PoCs)]] for exploitation, responsible disclosure to vendors, or contributing to bug bounty programs. This process is manual, time-intensive, and requires deep technical expertise.
