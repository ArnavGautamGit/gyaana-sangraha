# Devichandraguptam
> A play written in [[Sanskrit\|Sanskrit]] by [[Vishakhadeva\|Vishakhadeva]] (who may or may not be [[Vishakhadatta\|Vishakhadatta]]). It is about the two brothers [[Rāmagupta\|Rāmagupta]] & [[Chandragupta II of Ujjain\|Chandragupta]]. While the original play is lost, it is reconstructed from fragments discovered along with other sources quoting the original.

Although the existence of Rāmagupta is often doubted & debated but as many as 3 jain temples mention him on their inscriptions meaning he was more likely to be real than fake & this play is most likely based on real events.

### Plot of the Play
The play mentions that Emperor [[Samudragupta\|Samudragupta]] had two sons named [[Rāmagupta\|Rāma]] and [[Chandragupta II of Ujjain\|Chandra]] respectively. Among the two of them since Rāma was the elder son hence it was decided that he would inherit the throne in 375 AD. The story goes that during the Gupta-Śaka conflict, when the [[Western Kshatrapa\|Śaka]] kings layed seige to one of their camps/castles, the stalemate could only brokered by the ransom demanded by the Śaka King including that Rāmagupta surrender his wife, [[Dhruvadevi\|Dhruvadevi]]. 

Chandra is angered by Rāmagupta reluctantly agreeing to this settlement & sees one of the servants carrying a saree as parting gift the Queen had sent to one of her most loyal servants named Madhava-devi. The Court jester (Atreya) suggests Chandra to take the clothes & go into the enemy camp as the Queen to kill the Śaka Lord. On his advice, Chandra takes the saree & tells his plan to his elder brother that he (Chandra) himself will enter the enemy camp in the royal saree he is wearing right now so that the enemies think it is the the Queen Consort [[Dhruvadevi\|Dhruvadevi]]. His elder brother King [[Rāmagupta\|Rāmagupta]] tells him that he would "donate" his wife "like straw" rather than "lose" his brother. Unbeknownest to both of them, [[Dhruvadevi\|Dhruvadevi]] heard this conversation & thought King Rāmagupta was cheating on her with Madhava-devi (since Chandra is dressed up as her loyal servant she donated the saree to).

At the camp, Chandra came dressed as Dhruvadevi and brought along a few soldiers dressed as female servants to "herself". When the Śaka Lord takes "Dhruvadevi" in his tent to have sex with "her", Chandra kills the Śaka Lord and tells the other Śaka soldiers that the Lord is asleep from exhaustion after sex. Chandra along with his "female" guards kills every single enemy soldier in the camp (probably by poisioning). After returning from a successful mission, Chandra becomes the hero in the eyes of the subjects while the image of Rāma becomes weak in the public eye. The Emperor (Rāmagupta) starts to get jealous of his brother's popularity and decides to prosecute him of taking military action without royal permission. Chandra is warned of the same by other servants of [[Dhruvadevi\|Dhruvadevi]] that there is danger to his life, Chandra also finds out that [[Dhruvadevi\|Dhruvadevi]] thinks Rāmagupta is cheating on her and the Queen resents the King i.e., she needs Chandra alive to support her in getting out of a resentful marriage. Chandra decides to put on an act of having slipped into madness (probably implied to be PTSD) to avoid prosecution. 

Eventually, citing that Rāma is a weak ruler he dethrones his elder brother (by assassination) at the end of the play & marries [[Dhruvadevi\|Dhruvadevi]] when she confesses that the reason she wanted Chandra alive was that she began to love him after Rāma's cheating scandal came to her light citing that atleast Chandra was trying to protect her & the kingdom - making Chandra the better candidate to be King and also her husband.

### Adaptations
Many Adaptations were made on this. Even in Arabic! The first adaptation was made in India by [[King Bhoja\|King Bhoja]] in various Indian Languages. "[[Majmal-ut-Tawarikh (play)\|Majmal-ut-Tawarikh (play)]]" was the Persian Translation to the Arabic adaptation of this story with Rawwal replacing [[Rāmagupta\|Rāmagupta]] and Barkamaris replacing [[Chandragupta II of Ujjain\|Chandragupta]]. The Arabic work mentions itself as a translation of another unspecified [[Sanskrit\|Sanskrit]] ("Hindwani") play.

### Unrelated Texts with similar plot
In the [[Prose Edda\|Prose Edda]] story of [[Þrymskviða\|Þrymskviða]] in [[Norse Mythology\|Norse Mythology]], the [[Æsir Gods & Goddesses\|God]] of Thunder [[Thor\|Thor]] goes into a Jötnar camp dressed as [[Vanir Gods & Goddesses\|Goddess]] Freya to retreive his hammer [[Mjölnir\|Mjölnir]] before killing all the [[Jötnar\|Jötnar]] in that camp. Although the act of [[Cross-Dressing\|Cross-Dressing]] to infiltrate an enemy camp is same in both of them & the end result of killing all the enemies remains the same, the objective of undergoing the operation remains completely different.

### Title of the Play
Although similar to another play, [[Mālvikāgnimitram\|Mālvikāgnimitram]] (by [[Kālidāsa\|Kālidāsa]]) the title merges the names of the female & male protagonists of the play but the reasoning to put "Devi" instead of "Dhruvadevi" or "Dhruvi" or similar prefixes may include brevity and the use of Devi giving the play an alternate translation/meaning as Devi is also a title used for Queens in [[Sanskrit\|Sanskrit]] Salutation which stands for "Her Ladyship" i.e., the title can also be read as "Devi (Her Ladyship) Chandragupta" foreshadowing the plot.
