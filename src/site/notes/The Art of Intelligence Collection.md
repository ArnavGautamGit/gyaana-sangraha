# The Art of Intelligence Collection
- Spy never does the dangerous job himself.
- They recruit, train and handle people willing to lie & steal secrets & manipulate people in the target country.
- The need to build these layers are to protect the spy from detection in areas where the local counter-intelligence is active.
- These layers must not be too deep, since then there is a risk of information being morphed or the one of the links being sabotaged in the chain.
- The spy must not directly act in any way which is deemed unlawful or anything which is considered as "anti-national" by the local government/community - but be in some way shape of form connected to the said people via a chain/layer as explained above.
- The information collected from such high-premium sources, combined with indirect support of anti-nationals (who may provide the spy with a place to stay and food or job when push comes to shove), it is the spy's job to now combine the information collected and send it to his senior as an analysed report - where analysis is depicted in the form of a code. The code is only known among the two parties.
- Due to [[The Risks taken by Intelligence Agencies\|The Risks taken by Intelligence Agencies]], they prefer grooming the locals of the said country/community now.
- The Spy needs to know the following skills:
	- [[Memorise Without Written Evidence\|Memorise Without Written Evidence]] 
	- [[Raising Safe Houses\|Raising Safe Houses]] 
	- [[Surviving Enhanced Interrogation\|Surviving Enhanced Interrogation]]
