# Dinar Coins
> Pronounced as "Dinaar" and also called "Nishka", these were a class of premium coins issued during the period of the [[Kushan Empire\|Kushans]] made of pure gold.

Dinar coins inspired many Middle-Eastern Countries to name their fiat currency as [[Dinar (Currency)\|Dinar]].
It can also be deduced that Dinar coin system may have inspired other major empires to use Gold and ended up creating the stereotype picked up by [[Compendiums/D&D Compendium/Dungeons & Dragons\|Dungeons & Dragons]] where Gold, Silver and Copper are used as currency.

### Construction
Dinar Coins were made of Gold and were successors of the Punchmarked [[Kārṣāpaṇa Coins\|Kārṣāpaṇa Coins]] since these could have much more detailed depictions of Hindu and Buddhist iconography such as depicting [[Lord Shiva\|Lord Shiva]] and [[Gautama Buddha\|Gautama Buddha]] on the coins apart from a fully detailed side-profile of the King's face.

Coins could be made to have text on it too - infact the Kushan Dinars had bilingual text in both [[Sanskrit\|Sanskrit]] and [[Gāndhāri Prakrit\|Gāndhāri Prakrit]] written using [[Kharoshti Script\|Kharoshti Script]] and [[Brāhmi Script\|Brāhmi Script]] respectively. 

### Circulation
Since the Pure Gold version was a premium currency, it saw lower circulation than the copper coins (not called dinars) were more in circulation.
