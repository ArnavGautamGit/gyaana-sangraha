# Rogue (DH)
> A [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/DH Character Creation#Character Class\|Character Class]] of the hidden ones. The best rogues go unnoticed and could range from small-time thieves to spies and assassins. They establish guilds to maintain connection amongsthemselves, meet future accomplices, hire out jobs. 

Some Rogues may know Magic, some may not. Unlike popular belief, there is a layer of honour among Rogues despite their being the sentiment that all ROgues are scoundrels. Optimise your character by prioritising [[Finesse\|Finesse]].

### Domains
Domains of a class decide the Domain Cards (and abilities) one gets to pick up.
Each class has 2 fixed Domains.
The Rogue's domains are: [[Midnight\|Midnight]] and [[Grace\|Grace]]

### Base Scores
Base [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Evasion Score\|Evasion Score]]: 12
Base [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/General/Hit Point Slots\|Hit Point Slots]]: 6

### Class Items
Each Class has a specific item they choose which will be a plot point in the story. They must choose one of the options.
For a Rogue, choose EITHER *"Set of Forgery Tools"* OR *"Grappling Hook"*.

### Rogue's Hope - Special Ability
***Rogue’s Dodge***: Spend 3x [[Hope Token\|Hope Token]] to gain a +2 bonus to your [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Evasion Score\|Evasion Score]] until the next time an attack succeeds against you. Otherwise, this bonus lasts until your next rest.

### Class Feature - Cloaked & Sneak Attack
***Cloaked*** is the alternate to the [[Hidden\|Hidden]] Status for Rogues. It provides everything that hidden state does but it also allows to remain unseen if you are stationary when an adversary moves to where they would normally see you. After you make an attack or end a move within line of sight of an adversary, you are no longer Cloaked.

***Sneak Attack*** When you succeed on an attack while Cloaked or while an ally is within Melee range of your target, add a number of d6s equal to your tier to your damage roll.

### Class Foundations (Subclasses)
Every Class has a few subclasses you can choose from. For Rogue, choose between Syndicate or Nightwalker Subclasses.

- ***==Syndicate==*** makes it so that in every new location the Rogue knows someone in the said location via the Syndicate. Spellcasting Trait is [[Finesse\|Finesse]].
	- ***Foundation Feature***
		- ***Well-Connected:*** When you arrive at at town, you have atleast one named NPC contact. Choose how they would be useful from this list:
			- They owe me a favor, but they will be hard to find.
			- They’re going to ask for something in exchange.
			- They’re always in a great deal of trouble.
			- We used to be together. It’s a long story.
			- We didn't part on good terms.
	- ***Specialisation Feature***
		- ***Contacts Everywhere:*** Once per session, you can briefly call upon a shady contact. Immediately choose one of the benefits and describe what brought them here at this time.
			- The contact provides 1 handful of Gold, a unique tool, a non-magical mundane object that the situation requires.
			- The next time you make an Action Roll, their help lets you increase the result of either one of your [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Duality Dice\|Duality Dice]] by 3.
			- The next time you deal damage, the contact snipes from the shadows, adding 2d8 to your damage roll.
	- ***Mastery Feature***
		- ***Reliable Backup:*** "Contacts Everywhere" can be used thrice per session. You can also choose one of the following answers:
			- When you mark 1 or more [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/General/Hit Point Slots\|Hit Point Slots]], the contact rushes out to shield you and reducing incoming damage by 1 HP Slot.
			- When you make a Presence Roll in conversation, they back you up. Your Hope dice becomes a d20 for the roll.
- ***==Nightwalker==*** allows you to play a Stealth Attacker who uses the shadows. Spellcasting Trait is [[Finesse\|Finesse]] here as well.
	- ***Foundation Feature***
		- **Shadow Stepper**: Mark a [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Stress Point\|Stress Point]] when moving from one shadowed area to another shadow within Far Range while maintaining the "Hidden" State.
	- ***Specialisation Feature***
		- **Dark Cloud**: On a successful Spellcast Roll using [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Duality Dice\|Duality Dice]] against a difficulty of 15 (i.e., roll 15 or higher). Cast a temporary smoke bomb which covers an area of Close Range. Anyone outside it cannot see in, anyone inside cannot see out. Additionally, You are cloaked for any enemies whose vision is blocked by the cloud.
		- **Adrenaline**: Whenever [[Vulnerable\|Vulnerable]], add your Level to damage roll total.
	- ***Mastery Feature***
		- ***Fleeting Shadow:*** Gain a permanent +1 bonus to your [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Evasion Score\|Evasion Score]]. You can use your “Shadow Stepper” feature to move within Very Far Range.
		- ***Vanishing Act:*** Mark 1x [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Stress Point\|Stress Point]] to become Cloaked at any time. When Cloaked from this feature, you automatically clear the [[Restrained\|Restrained]] condition if you have it. You remain Cloaked in this way until you roll with Fear or until your next rest.

### Background Questions
It is optional to answer any of the following background questions to refine or get ideas for your character's backstory. You can also create your own questions. 
- What did you get caught doing that got you exiled from your home community?
- You used to have a different life, but you’ve tried to leave it behind. Who from your past is still chasing you?
- Who from your past were you most sad to say goodbye to?

### Connections
