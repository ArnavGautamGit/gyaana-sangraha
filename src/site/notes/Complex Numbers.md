# Complex Numbers
> Numbers that can be represented as being equivalent to the sum of a [[Real Numbers\|real]] and [[Imaginary Numbers\|imaginary number]].

The common mathematical representation of these numbers are: $$\Large z = x+iy$$
Some Countries also write the iota after the $\large y$, while others (like mine) prefer to write it before the number. I ma sure there is some convention or standard set for this but I am more comfortable writing like this and hence will be writing it like this.  

### Real-World Application of Concept
Complex Numbers form the core basics of many fields like Electrical Engineering (EE), Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE).
