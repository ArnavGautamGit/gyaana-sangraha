# Sunk-Cost Fallacy
> Tendency to keep investing time and money despite the investment being in vain just because you have already spent quite some time and money which would go to waste if you do not keep going.

This fallacy keeps you invested in something even when it is clearly not working out for you just because you have got so far. It is never ending cycle where evryday you would feel like quitting but you won't be able to.
