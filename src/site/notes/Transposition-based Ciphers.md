# Transposition-based Ciphers
> One of the [[Cryptographic Encryption Algorithms\|Cryptographic Encryption Algorithms]] in which letters or groups of letters (in patterns known as di-grams, tri-grams or more) of the message are rearranged.

These encryption algorithms are also called Transmutation Ciphers and Permutation Chiphers. They were specifically made to aim for ***diffusion*** ([[Transposition-based Ciphers#^1\|#^1]]). 

Some of the algorithms here were fairly popular in Field-use during [[The First World War (WW1)\|The First World War (WW1)]] for regular infantry (not spies).
