# Database Forensics
> Process of performing [[Digital Forensics\|Digital Forensics]] techniques on a Digital [[Database\|Database]] which includes (but is not limited to) collection, preservation, analysis and preservation of evidences obtained from said Database.

### Importance
Avoiding Losses caused by [[Security Incidents\|Security Incidents]] leads to leaking, stealing, manipulation or deletion of Critical & Sensitive Information like Bank details or worse.

### Aims
Figure out what exactly the cause, process and effect of any [[Security Incidents\|Security Incidents]] that have affected or hit the Database.

### Things to Consider
- How to regain access to the system
- Dead System vs Live System
- [[Integrity\|Integrity]], [[Cryptography\|Cryptography]], Image and Goal.

### Motivation
- [[Data Privacy\|Data Privacy]] is one of the fundamental issues today - especially when the digital healthcare services are getting more & more common.
- Providing security to rapidly increasing number of [[Electronic Health Records (EHR)\|Electronic Health Records (EHR)]] which improve communication between healthcare provider and the end user (which maybe the patient, their family member or a representative).

### Dilemma: Privacy or Transparency?
The Data Mining Companies do not want to respect our [[Data Privacy\|Data Privacy]] but why? For data to yield good research and accurate results, it needs to have transparency... 

[[Data Anonymisation\|Data Anonymisation]] hides the names of the original patient but the it cannot be reversed. Helping Privacy but hurting Transparency.

Same for [[Cryptography\|Encryption]], Data is protected but it is only reversible by the original user and not by the researcher who needs this data to draw inferences.

We know without any encryption, it offers no [[Data Privacy\|Data Privacy]], which is of no use (and illegal).
[[Data Pseudonymisation\|Data Pseudonymisation]] is the solution! It replaces identifiers with pseudonyms but since the pseudonyms are consistent, it can still be used to draw inferences and research any common.
