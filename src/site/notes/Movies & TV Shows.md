# Movies & TV Shows
> A list or Catalogue of movies I have watched along with those that I own Physically or Digitally either as physical DVDs, Bluray Discs or even MP4s & MKVs ripped from Bluray. 
> 
> This is a website-readable section taken from the Movies & TV pages of [[Media Review.base|Media Review]] file made using Obsidian Bases.

I personally love [[Blu-Ray Discs\|Blurays]] more than other mediums but alas, it is not a widely adopted medium in India as new content goes straight to Streaming Services (often called OTT).

## Watched in Theatre

## Owned Media on Digital/Disc
In the following table, DVDs that my dad bought for me during his business visit to China are labelled separately as "Chinese DVD" instead of just DVD. This is also because I suspect they might be some counterfeit/bootleg discs and not originals.
