# Computer Malware
The term Malware is an amalgamation/concatenation of the words, 'Malicious' and 'Software'.  
**_MAL_**icious + soft**_WARE_** = **_MALWARE_**  
Malware is also sometimes known as Malicious Code or Rogue program.

Malware is always planted by an agent with a malicious intention to cause harm.  
It is made to harm by invoking specific effects: like overloading the memory so it becomes unavailable.

## Components of a Malware
We use the analogy of a missile launch to explain the components since it is easy to explain.

- **_==Spreading Mechanism==_**: A mechanism by which the malware spreads or propagates. In missile analogy, Launch Capability of the missile. (Air/sea/surface/subsurface launch capability etc)
- **_==Trigger==_**: The specific event/requirement; which when fulfilled, the Malware starts working. The button with which the missile is launched. Here, it is assumed that the "coordinates are already set" since it has entered the system.
- **_==Payload==_**: Warhead of the missile - _the actual malicious code that attacks the system_. The entire program with all its files are not malicious... the malicious file is safely hidden in a sea of seemingly genuine files.

## Classification of Malware
There are 3 different types of malware on the basis of intent.

1. **_==Non-Destructive==_**: Made to spread panic. Does not destroy or touch a single file.
2. **_==Destructive==_**: Corruption or Deletion of files is the top-most intent.
3. **_==Commercial Intent==_**: Extracting money directly using ransomware or indirectly by selling data collected or selling passwords for money (particularly passwords found by keyloggers injected into the target system. Although some hackers may use the keyloggers to log in themselves)
