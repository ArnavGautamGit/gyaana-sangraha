# What is the book about?
This book is about:
1. Identify key areas in life where you want to improve. If needed or too busy, set priorities in those areas to prioritise one area over another. Start with 5min habits.
2. Focus on small wins: things that do not require much willpower. Start with just one maximum 30min stack of 6 habits (5min each). Add stacks as you go.
3. Do not try to do everything in the book (mentioned by author). Your key areas are different.
4. Anchor stack to a *trigger* event. Use checklists to maintain stack.
5. Focus on not dropping off for more than 1 day.
6. How to use productive Habit Stacks to do certain things in a flow.
7. How do Habit Stacks work and how to make the most of them
