# Computer Malware
The term Malware is an amalgamation/concatenation of the words, 'Malicious' and 'Software'.  
**_MAL_**icious + soft**_WARE_** = **_MALWARE_**  
Malware is also sometimes known as Malicious Code or Rogue program.

Malware is always planted by an agent with a malicious intention to cause harm.  
It is made to harm by invoking specific effects: like overloading the memory so it becomes unavailable.

## Components of a Malware
We use the analogy of a missile launch to explain the components since it is easy to explain.

- **_==Spreading Mechanism==_**: A mechanism by which the malware spreads or propagates. In missile analogy, Launch Capability of the missile. (Air/sea/surface/subsurface launch capability etc)
- **_==Trigger==_**: The specific event/requirement; which when fulfilled, the Malware starts working. The button with which the missile is launched. Here, it is assumed that the "coordinates are already set" since it has entered the system.
- **_==Payload==_**: Warhead of the missile - _the actual malicious code that attacks the system_. The entire program with all its files are not malicious... the malicious file is safely hidden in a sea of seemingly genuine files.

## Classification of Malware
There are 3 different types of malware on the basis of intent.

1. **_==Non-Destructive==_**: Made to spread panic. Does not destroy or touch a single file.
2. **_==Destructive==_**: Corruption or Deletion of files is the top-most intent.
3. **_==Commercial Intent==_**: Extracting money directly using ransomware or indirectly by selling data collected or selling passwords for money (particularly passwords found by keyloggers injected into the target system. Although some hackers may use the keyloggers to log in themselves)

Other Types of Malware:
- [[Computer Virus\|Virus]]
- [[Computer Worm\|Worm]]
- [[Trojan Horse (Malware)\|Trojan Horse (Malware)]]
- [[Rootkit (Malware)\|Rootkit (Malware)]]
- [[Ransomware\|Ransomware]]
- [[Spyware\|Spyware]]

## Top Five Signs of Malware Infection
Most of these signs can be picked up by EDRs automatically but if you want to do things independently then these are the signs:

1. Detect Events (on Windows use Event Viewer)
	1. Event IDs of 4688, 4624, 4625 etc (anything starting with 46)
	2. Check Events on these paths in Linux: `/var/log/audit` or `var/log/secure` or `/var/log/auth.d`
2. Check Activity
	1. Comms on ports: 4444, 1377 or [[The Onion Router (TOR)\|TOR]] ports like 9050 or 9150
	2. Command & Control (C&C) traffic
	3. Firewall & SIEM logs (like [[Splunk\|Splunk]] logs)
3. Registry Modification 
	1. Event IDs starting with 13 for registry mods
	2. Event IDs starting with 11 for File Creation
4. [[Privilege Escalation\|Privilege Escalation]] 
	1. Unexpected Admin Accounts (Event IDs 4720, 4728)
	2. Sudden Privilege Escalation (Even IDs 4672)
5. Resource Spike
	1. Service Creation or Termination (Event IDs 7034 and 7036)
	2. Tools that could give you resource alarms.
