# Christianity Equates non-Christians to Beasts without souls
In Christianity, absence of religion is considered as an absence of soul with a soul being the entity needed to communicate and connect with the divine [[God in Christianity\|Christian God]] and hence these natives since they were without souls could be mercilessly murdered, raped, pillaged and burned without any remorse since it is their lack of souls which makes them worship nature over God who created nature. 

Entire communities and societies were associated by Soullessness and needing to be "saved" by conversion to their religion.

The Christian Priest via the process of conversion and baptism enfuses the soulless beast with a soul which can now communicate with God.

In the eyes of the European Christian Coloniser, the process was not of just "saving" the person but breathing a soul into a satan-worshipping subhuman species and turning them into a human Christian by a "civilising touch" or "healing touch" depending upon if the person you ask were affiliated to the church or not. If they are, they shall call it "healing touch". If they are like from a colonialist background, they will call it a "civilising touch" although everyone uses "healing touch" since it sounds less barbaric (ironically it did not stop them from DOING the barbaric acts).

It is no surprise why [[Winston Churchill's Opinions on Indians\|Winston Churchill's Opinions on Indians]] were similar to this very description since Christianity equates all infidels and idol-worshippers as soulless beasts who need "saving".

According to Nassima Dalal in her paper "The Impact of Colonial Contact of the Cultural Heritage of Native American Indian People", conversion occured to convert as many people as possible and to take the land of the indigenous people. Interestingly, the Catholic Church is one of the largest individual land-owners in India (excluding the Government of India itself) along with the Sunni and Shia Waqf Boards since Islam also operates on a similar track being Abrahamic just like Christianity.

Notes are based on what I learnt from reading the source in the footnote and the book [[Books Library/India, that is Bharat\|India, that is Bharat]] by [[J. Sai Deepak\|J. Sai Deepak]].
