# Daggerheart Combat Rules
> Rules for combat and encounters in the Narrative-based [[Table-Top Role-Playing Game\|TTRPG]] named [[Daggerheart\|Daggerheart]]. These Rules include any Homebrew Rules and are non-negotiable.

The Rules are fairly simple but for ease of reading and navigation, I have divided them into Two Separate Sections named "Player Turn" and "GM's Turn"

### Player's Turn
- The players use the [[Duality Dice\|Duality Dice]] to roll their Attack Rolls which need to yield a result higher than the adversary's [[Evasion Score\|Evasion Score]] to succeed. Player gets a [[Hope Token\|Hope Token]] if they roll with hope or the GM gains a [[Fear Token\|Fear Token]] if they roll with Fear.
	- If the Attack Roll Succeeds, the Player Rolls for damage using the weapon's damage dice. With the number of dice rolled depending upon the [[Proficiency Level\|Proficiency Level]] (starting at 1).
	- If the Attack Roll Fails, it is the [[DH Combat Rules#GM's Turn\|GM's Turn]] to attack the players.

### GM's Turn
- The [[Game Master (GM)\|Game Master (GM)]] uses their d20 dice to roll for attacks. The Attack Roll needs to beat the targeted Player Character's [[Evasion Score\|Evasion Score]].
	- [[Game Master (GM)\|GMs]] can use their reservoir of [[Fear Token\|Fear Tokens]] to make the Adversaries stronger by adding the number of Fear Tokens as Modifiers to the result of the d20 roll. Each Token gives +1 to the roll.
	- If the Attack Roll Succeeds, the Player can lower the damage to a lower threshold by using an Armour Slot.
	- If the Attack Roll fails, the GM will need to use another [[Fear Token\|Fear Token]] to retain the turn, else it is the [[DH Combat Rules#Player's Turn\|Player's Turn]] again.
