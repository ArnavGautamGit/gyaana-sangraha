# Colonial Origin of Indian Polity
> Due to familiarity and many members of the [[Drafting Committee\|Drafting Committee]] like [[Dr. Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar\|Dr. BR Ambedkar]] being the members of the Viceroy's Council, many of the rules that shaped the Indian Political System were based on the British Rules. 

Notes taken from the book: "Indian Polity" by M. Laxmikanth and notes from the "Success in Prelims" batch of StudyIQ IAS.
It is recommended to also read the Class 11th and 12th NCERT for Political Science and other [[General Awareness\|General Studies]] subjects.

## 1770 to 1856
After the [[British East India Company\|British East India Company]] had begun to capture all three major power centres in India, namely Bengal, Madras and Bombay - there was a Governor appointed in each centre of power, meaning a total of 3 governors were governing the land.

Meanwhile in Britain, serious discussions and debates began on whether an entity like the [[British East India Company\|British East India Company]] be regulated or not since it is essentially a private company with its own army and political power. (hereafter East India Company will be referred to as "EIC")

In 1773, the intense and lengthy discussions had beared fruit - The [[Regulating Act of 1773\|Regulating Act of 1773]] was passed and this set the precedent for the slow and gradual interference of the British Crown. The Act was passed as the public opinion of EIC's employees and higher ups being corrupt meant that it must be brought under regulation.

Under this legislation, the position of "Governor of Bengal" would be renamed to the designation of "Governor-General of Bengal" and act as the sole point of communication between India and the EIC's higher ups sitting in Britain and the Governor General Executive Council (GGEC) of 4 members was set up to assist the Governor-General of Bengal (hereafter referred to as GGB). While [[Robert Clive\|Robert Clive]] served as the first GB, [[Warren Hastings\|Warren Hastings]] served as the first GGB.

In 1781, the act was ammended to exempt the GGB from the jurusduction of the British Supreme Court. Also in 1781, [[Charles Cornwallis\|Charles Cornwallis]] loses the [[American War of Independence\|American War of Independence]] and is promptly shifted to the position of as the second Governor General of Bengal, replacing [[Warren Hastings\|Warren Hastings]]. Cornwallis reached India in 1986 and played a major role in leading the EIC through the [[Third Anglo-Mysore War (1790-1792)\|Third Anglo-Mysore War (1790-1792)]] and defeating [[Tipu Sultan\|Tipu Sultan]]. Cornwallis also introduced Civil & Property Rights to the people. 

Until the [[Pitts India Act of 1784\|Pitts India Act of 1784]] was passed, the EIC was ran by a 24-person elected body known as "Court of Directors" who were electorally chosen among the 900 or so shareholders of the company - this new act added additional British Control by creating a new layer of administration over the existing Court of Directors (CoD) by adding a panel of people who represented the British Government known as the Board of Control (BoC). The GGEC was also shortened to 3 members.

Due to additional charges of Corruption in the CoD (or rumours and planted evidence of the same) the Company was then operated on the basis of [[The Charter Act of 1793\|The Charter Act of 1793]]. According to this Charter, the EIC would be run under a license of 20 years which can be extended for another 20 years if the Parliament passes a new Charter. Also under this act, the salary of all BoC was to be paid by the EIC (the salaries were not nominal) and incentivised the EIC to loot India more efficiently.

According to the Charter, EIC cannot attack any sovereign powers abroad without the assent of the Crown. Which was brought in place to stop the EIC acquiring more territory and eventually get stronger than the Crown itself - potentially creating a new country or threatening to overthrow the Queen. This restriction also meant that the EIC could not try to recapture the 13 Colonies after their loss in the [[American War of Independence\|American War of Independence]] in the [[American Revolution\|American Revolution]] in 1781.

[[The Charter Act of 1813\|The Charter Act of 1813]] brought with it the End of Trade Monopoly except Tea & trade with China due to the [[Continental Trade Blockade\|Continental Trade Blockade]] impplemented by [[Napoleon Bonaparte\|Napoleon Bonaparte]] and his allies in other countries of Europe. So the traders now have to sell their good somewhere and that somewhere ended up being India! To increase the taste in English Goods, annual expenditure of Rupees 1 lakh in christian missionary education and created fake drama around Sati being extensively practiced (see [[Fake Narrative around Sati\|Fake Narrative around Sati]]).

20 years later, [[The Charter Act of 1833\|The Charter Act of 1833]] brought a few more changes, 
Firstly, the post of Governor-General of the Presidency of Fort William in Bengal was renamed to the "Governor-General of India" with [[William Bentinck\|William Bentinck]] being the first GGI.
Secondly, [[Thomas Babington Macaulay\|Thomas Babington Macaulay]] was sent as a Legislative Member/Advisor of GGEC.
Thirdly, the EIC now had legislative and administrative powers as trade matters have basically ended.

The last of the relevant charters were in [[The Charter Act of 1853\|The Charter Act of 1853]] where the Legislative & Executive Powers separated - [[Thomas Babington Macaulay\|Thomas Babington Macaulay]] would lead the new legislative body named "Governor General Legislative Council" or GGLC with 5 members along with Macaulay.

## 1858-1947
The [[First Revolution of Indian Independence (1857)\|First Revolution of Indian Independence (1857)]] caused a huge uproar and citing the fact that none within the [[British East India Company\|British East India Company]]'s Court of Directors had any idea or experience in administration & politics, the new law named "Act for the Betterment of India" was brought in to suspend the CoD from working in India and India being in direct British Crown's control. The First Viceroy of India was Canning.

GGLC introduced the [[Indian Penal Code (IPC)\|Indian Penal Code (IPC)]] in the year 1860. Which was still the Criminal Code used to procsecute criminals in India until it was replaced on 25th December 2024 by the [[Bharatiya Nyaya Samhita (BNS)\|Bharatiya Nyaya Samhita (BNS)]] after it received the President's Assent & eventually came into force on 1st July 2025.

The Indian Government at the time was still ran by GGEC and GGLC renamed to remove the mention of the Governor-General & instead call it Viceroy Executive Council and the Viceroy Legislative Council until [[Indian Council Act (1861)\|Indian Council Act (1861)]] introduced the portfolio system where each member of the Council had a particular role only. This was also when Indians were allowed to join the Viceroy's Executive Council - starting with the biggest Indian Stooges. It was further ammended in 1992 to also add the powers to discuss budget and choose Indian members by Indirect Elections.

Government in India was then governed using the [[Government of India Act (1909)\|Government of India Act (1909)]].
It played on the British motive of divide and rule as it had a separate electorate for Muslims.
Indians in the Viceroy's Executive Council were also allowed now. 

[[Government of India Act (1919)\|Government of India Act (1919)]] introduced Bicameral Legislature, Voting Rights to few based on educational qualification, tax capability and who can be the bigger stooge. It included Demarcation of subjects into Central & Provincial Lists. Dyrarchy was introduced in provinces (Nawab/Nizam/King with Provincial Legislative bodies)

[[Government of India Act (1935)\|Government of India Act (1935)]] expanded voting rights and reserved seats for women, it also allowed for Bicameralism in provinces, provincial autonomy (dyrarchy was ended) and it proposed the All India Federation which failed. ***It was ==THIS== act which formed the base of the Indian Parliamentary System***.
