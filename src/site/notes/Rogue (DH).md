# Rogue (DH)
> A [[DH Character Creation#Character Class\|Character Class]] of the hidden ones. The best rogues go unnoticed and could range from small-time thieves to spies and assassins. They establish guilds to maintain connection amongsthemselves, meet future accomplices, hire out jobs. 

Some Rogues may know Magic, some may not. Unlike popular belief, there is a layer of honour among Rogues despite their being the sentiment that all ROgues are scoundrels. Optimise your character by prioritising [[Finesse\|Finesse]].

### Domains
Domains of a class decide the Domain Cards (and abilities) one gets to pick up.
Each class has 2 fixed Domains.
The Rogue's domains are: [[Midnight\|Midnight]] and [[Grace\|Grace]]

### Base Scores
Base [[Evasion Score\|Evasion Score]]: 11
Major Damage Threshold: 6
Severe Damage Threshold: 12

### Class Items
Each Class has a specific item they choose which will be a plot point in the story. They must choose one of the options.
For a Rogue, choose EITHER *"Forgery Tools"* OR *"Grappling Hook"*.

### Rogue's Hope - Special Ability
Spend 3x [[Hope Token\|Hope Token]] to increase Sneak Attack Damage to 3d6 instead of 1d6 to Sneak Attack Damage Roll.

### Class Feature - Hide & Sneak Attack
***Hide*** allows you to stay hidden in an area when no enemies can see you. All rolls against you are at disadvantage. Enemies cannot see you while you are hidden. Your Character ceases to be "Hidden" if you move or attack. 
On my table, Talking while being "Hidden" is allowed but it may give enemies a rough area of where to look.

***Sneak Attack*** is an attack that can be made with [[Duality Dice#Advantage & Disadvantage\|advantage]] when Hidden or while the target is in melee with another ally. In Advantage, we add a d6 dice to the [[Duality Dice\|Duality Dice]] rolls but in Sneak Attack, we can increase the number of d6 dice rolled for Advantage to be equal to the number of [[Hope Token\|Hope Tokens]] added.

### Class Foundations (Subclasses)
Every Class has a few subclasses you can choose from. For Rogue, choose between Syndicate or Nightwalker Subclasses.

- ***==Syndicate==*** makes it so that in every new location the Rogue knows someone in the said location via the Syndicate. Spellcasting Trait is [[Finesse\|Finesse]].
	- ***Foundation Feature***
		- When you arrive at at town, you have atleast one named NPC contact. Choose how they would be useful from this list:
			- They owe me a favor, but they will be hard to find.
			- They’re going to ask for something in exchange.
			- They’re always in a great deal of trouble.
			- We used to be together. It’s a long story.
			- We didn't part on good terms.
	- ***Specialisation Feature***
		- Once per session, you can briefly call upon a shady contact. Immediately choose one of the benefits and describe what brought them here at this time.
			- The contact provides 1 handful of Gold, a unique tool, a non-magical mundane object that the situation requires.
			- The next time you make an Action Roll, their help lets you increase the result of either one of your [[Duality Dice\|Duality Dice]] by 3.
			- The next time you deal damage, the contact snipes from the shadows, adding 2d8 to your damage roll.
	- ***Mastery Feature***
		- Specialisation Feature can be used thrice per session. You can also choose one of the following answers:
			- When you mark 1 or more [[Hit Point Slots\|Hit Point Slots]], the contact rushes out to shield you and reducing incoming damage by 1 HP Slot.
			- When you make a Presence Roll in conversation, they back you up. Your Hope dice becomes a d20 for the roll.
- ***==Nightwalker==*** allows you to play a Stealth Attacker who uses the shadows. Spellcasting Trait is [[Finesse\|Finesse]] here as well.
	- ***Foundation Feature***
		- **Shadow Stepper**: Mark a [[Stress Point\|Stress Point]] when moving from one shadow or area of darkness to another area of darkness/shadow within far range while maintaining the "Hidden" State.
	- ***Specialisation Feature***
		- **Dark Cloud**: On a successful Spellcast Roll using [[Duality Dice\|Duality Dice]] against a difficulty of 15 (i.e., roll 15 or higher). Cast a temporary smoke bomb which covers an area of Close Range. Anyone outside it cannot see in, anyone inside cannot see out.
		- **Adrenaline**: Whenever [[Vulnerable State (DH)\|Vulnerable]], add your Level to damage roll total.
	- ***Mastery Feature***
		- Your Evasion permanently increases by +1, and you can now use Shadow Stepper to move within Very Far range.
		- **Cloaked**: At any time, you can mark a Stress to cloak yourself. While cloaked, you gain the benefits of the Hidden condition and automatically lose the Restrained condition if you have it. You stop being cloaked when you roll with Fear or start a short rest.
