# Economics of any Business
> All the terms and calculations that you must know when trying to understand how businesses are run.
> Not to be confused with: [[Business Economics\|Business Economics]]

Any Business first needs to be set-up, then produce some goods or services (R&D is a process that burns cash) and then start selling the product/service once it is complete.

## Basic Principle of Profit
Any business that is created or started is for profit (unless stated otherwise).
We all know the basic formula of Business:
$$\Large \text{Profit} = \text{Revenue} - \text{Total Cost}$$
Apart from there being different types of costs that need to be accounted for, there also is the aspect of how a business is set-up. The latter requires raising [[Paid-Up Capital\|Paid-Up Capital]] or requires to take [[Debt\|Debt]] in the form of [[Borrowed Capital\|Borrowed Capital]].

Raised [[Capital\|Capital]] is used to acquire [[Land\|Land]], [[Asset\|Assets]] and other [[Factors of Production (FOP)\|Factors of Production (FOP)]].
This investment is later used as a yardstick to measure statistics like [[Cummulative Profit\|Cummulative Profit]] and [[Break-Even Point\|Break-Even Point]].

## Types of Costs involved in Business 
Here the Total Cost is divided into a few categories:
- [[Direct Cost\|Direct Cost]], also called Variable Cost is the direct cost involved in making the good to be sold.
	- It includes things like cost of raw materials, machines and electricity to power the machines
- [[Indirect Cost\|Indirect Cost]] is the cost related to the salaries of factory workers and any food or water being provided to them by the business owner.
- [[Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)\|Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)]] is the sum of Direct & Indirect Costs given above.
- [[Sales & Marketing Costs\|Sales & Marketing Costs]] cover the cost of marketing and selling the product from flyers, billboards, ads etc to the salary of sales dept employees.
	- Sometimes it Discounts and Schemes are also counted here.
	- Certain businesses which value their [[Selling Efficiency\|Selling Efficiency]] may account Sales Costs and Marketing Costs separately.
- [[Cost of General Overheads\|Cost of General Overheads]] contains all the general costs for any common overheads of the business (specific overheads are already covered in COGS). 
	- It includes the salaires of employees in common departments like HR, Finance and Senior Management of the company.
	- It also includes other expenses like Maintainance & Repair.

## How is Profit Calculated?
When we see the terms used such as [[Gross Revenue\|Gross Revenue]] it refers to the the Invoice Value, which includes all the [[Goods & Service Tax (GST)\|Goods & Service Tax (GST)]] that the business later pays to the Government.

When the [[Indirect Tax\|Indirect Tax]] is paid to the Government, the remaining revenue is known as [[Net Revenue\|Net Revenue]].
$$\Large \text{Gross Revenue} - \text{GST} = \text{Net Revenue}$$
Now, from the Net Revenue if we subtract the [[Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)\|COGS]], we get [[Gross Margin\|Gross Margin]].
$$\Large \text{Net Revenue} - \text{Cost of Goods Sold} = \text{Gross Margin}$$
Now if we remove other costs like [[Sales & Marketing Costs\|Sales & Marketing Costs]] and [[Cost of General Overheads\|Cost of General Overheads]], we get the [[EBITDA\|EBITDA]]. 
$$\Large \text{EBITDA} = \text{Gross Margin} - \text{Other Costs}$$

The Operating Profit of the Business needs to be calculated from the EBITDA, unless it is a debt-free business.
$$\Large \text{EBDT} = \text{EBITDA} - \text{Interest \& Debt Repayment Installments}$$

On top of the EBDT, businesses often claim [[Depreciation\|Depreciation]]. This gives you Earnings-before-Tax, often called [[Profit-before-Tax (PBT)\|Profit-before-Tax (PBT)]].
$$\Large \text{EBDT} - \text{Depreciation} = \text{PBT}$$

Many businesses are profitable at EBDT or EBITDA but loss-making at [[Profit-before-Tax (PBT)\|Profit-before-Tax (PBT)]]. This is because you can claim Depreciation as savings for repair of the assets the company owns, you do not actually pay them but one day you will use this money to replace your machines and repair your factory.

Finally when you have paid the [[Corporate Tax\|Corporate Tax]] and any other form of Taxation applicable, the company now has [[Profit-after-Tax (PAT)\|Profit-after-Tax (PAT)]].
$$\Large \text{PBT} - \text{Taxes} = \text{PAT}$$

So in the beginning the equation we saw actually looks like this:
$$\Large\text{PBT} = \text{Net Revenue} - \text{Total Costs} - \text{Interest} - \text{Depeciation}$$
The actual equation with Gross Revenue and all costs listed as "COGS" and "Other Costs" would be too long to fit in one line so I did not even bother with it, since it is understood.

## How is this Profit utilised?
If a business pays tax, then the [[Profit-after-Tax (PAT)\|Profit-after-Tax (PAT)]] (else EBDT) is used to pay for expansions and loan repayments. Else, the profit (or a part of it) may also be distributed as [[Dividends\|Dividends]] to the [[Shareholders\|Shareholders]] of [[Company Shares\|Company Shares]].
