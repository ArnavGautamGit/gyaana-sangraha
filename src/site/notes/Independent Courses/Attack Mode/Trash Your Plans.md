# Trash your Plans
> The Mantra is to realise that any and all plans you make before the journey to your goals will be based in preconceived notions or random advice from random people. As a result, these plans will be very clear, concise and follow a linear trajectory of steps; which is rarely how life is.

When you confine yourself to this kind of a linear plan it is very easy to see life's deviations from the plan as somehow getting further away from your goals & may put you through a panic. Anyone who has achieved the same goals will tell you that the Journey Of Life is not that linear - it is chaos that makes sense at the end of the journey when you have already achieved your goal due to [[Hindsight Bias\|Hindsight Bias]].

Heroes become Heroes not by announcing themselves as such, they become Heroes through all they have conquered and sacrificed through their journey to get there. It is a journey that makes a hero, not a suit of armour.

Everyone's journey is unique and it is important to know where the journey takes you. Don't take that away from yourself. A Dialogue from one of my favourite movies comes to mind:

> "Don't bring the percentages into this, Niki - don't be a pro. The minute you do that you kill what's good about this, you kill the sport."
> ~ James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) in the movie Rush (2013).

### What to do instead?
Work towards the destination and follow the JOURNEY.
Make a set of weekly tasks not attached to any specific linear goal.
You want to become a YouTuber? Daily Task is to work on a video and upload them according to your Upload Frequency.
You want to become a Coder? Daily Task to code and learn how to code. Soon you will realise that companies will demand a resume so you will make a resume.
You want to learn a hobby? Daily Task is to do it once a week.
