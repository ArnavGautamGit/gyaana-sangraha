# Earn More, Spend Less
> A phrase used to describe how to be richer and wealthier.

It is rumoured to be a Warren Buffet Quote, but I do not know if it actually is or not.
Spending Less on the same salary as we work to increase our salary in the near future.

### How to Earn More?
1. Be in a good surrounding in a specific city or country.
	1. Best talent from IITs and NITs goes abroad
	2. Same work pays more in a richer neighbourhood
2. Get excellent skill in ONE domain
	1. People tend to pay more for better skill
	2. People tend to pay more for specialised (niche) work.
	3. Good Employees make Good Employers (Entepreneurs)
3. Marry someone with low-spending dreams
	1. Hopefully your spouse should be working
	2. Spending in Salons and shit should be low
	3. Hopefully they should have a growth mindset
	4. Hopefully their priorities are in order
4. Be a constant learner
	1. Spend in Learning & Self-Development
	2. Competition decreases as we go to the top
	3. Social Skills =/= Extrovert

### How to spend less
1. Avoid influence from friends else it:
	1. breeds insecurity
	2. breeds FOMO
2. Focus on the present
	1. Ab yahaan se aage kaise jaana hai ye dekho
	2. Nikli hui train par focus mat karo
3. Prepare for big expenses
	1. ***Vehicles***: 15 saal ki limit hai, apni, spouse ki aur baccho ke liye leni hongi, life mein 8-10 lene padenge. Agar abhi car chhoti hai toh 2nd aur 3rd aur badi honi chahiye.
	2. ***Marriage***: Karja lene ki koi zarurat nahi hai, Parents se bolo ki venue se zyaada Gold aur Flats mein kharcha karein jisse aage chalke humaara faayda ho - Businessmen nahi hai jo badi statement dena zaruri hai.
	3. ***House***: Best is to live with parents, you can easily afford housing, buy and get more houses to give them on rent and create a rental income from them.
4. NEVER TAKE ANY LOAN EXCEPT MEDICAL OR HOUSE LOANS.
5. NEVER USE ANY CREDIT CARDS (if important, set auto-payment).

### Some Major DON'Ts
1. We never invest more than 20% of our potential in one asset
2. We never invest in an asset where there is a chance of our money becoming zero.
3. We never invest at the top
4. We never trust anyone who claims to predict or time the market.
