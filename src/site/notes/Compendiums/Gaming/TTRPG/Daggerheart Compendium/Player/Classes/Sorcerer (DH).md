# Sorcerer (DH)
> A [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/DH Character Creation#Character Class\|Character Class]] of powerful beings who have natural attunement to magic (unlike [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Classes/Wizard (DH)\|Wizards]] who have to study magic) and can be dangerous foes to fight. 

Sorcerers are basically [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Classes/Wizard (DH)\|Wizard (DH)]] which got their powers naturally hence they use the [[Arcana\|Arcana]] domain instead of the [[Codex\|Codex]] domain which is reserved for those who got their magic from intense study & practice. They are generally potrayed as if they have no control over their powers.

### Domains
Domains of a class decide the Domain Cards (and abilities) one gets to pick up.
Each Class has 2 fixed Domains.
The Sorcerer's domains are: [[Arcana\|Arcana]] and [[Midnight\|Midnight]].

### Base Scores
Base [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Evasion Score\|Evasion Score]]: 10
