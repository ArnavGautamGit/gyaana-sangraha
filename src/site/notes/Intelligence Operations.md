# Intelligence Operations
Definition:
> "Operations which are performed to extract [[Intelligence (Espionage)\|Intel]] from the target person/community/country."
> ~ My own understanding developed through the years.

According to Vikram Sood, the ex-R&AW chief,
> "Other aspects of [[National Security\|National Security]] flow from this \[i.e., Intelligence Operations]. Analysis, assessment and follow-up action is the result of such intelligence operations, \[Which] is what the rest of the system sees."
> ~ *'The Unending Game'*, page 14
