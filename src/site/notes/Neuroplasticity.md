# Neuroplasticity
> A scientific term used in Psychology to describe the process of learning in Humans. It states that the human brain makes a new connection everytime one does something new that they have never done before. Reinforcement and Solidification of these connections happen with consistent practice which also creates refined skill. 

Analogy: You could still theoretically "write" with your non-writing hand but the handwriting from that hand (on writing for the first time) will be so abysmal that the person attempting the challenge will cringe. The same challenge when repeated and practiced over and over helps the brain reinforce the connections & learn the behaviour and develop a refined handwriting from the non-writing hand.

It is important to note that the newly learnt behaviour CANNOT replace the old behaviour. It coexists. Old content can go latent but never disappear.
Citing our analogy again: learning how to write with the non-writing hand does not mean you forgot how to write with their main writing-hand.
