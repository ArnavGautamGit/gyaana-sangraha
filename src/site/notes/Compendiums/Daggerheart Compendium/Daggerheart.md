# Daggerheart
> A Table-Top Role-Playing Game made by Darrington Press & backed by Critical Role. It is releasing on 20th May 2025 but it has been already out in Open Beta since 2024.

This note acts as a player glossary/compendium for the rules and I have attempted to include everything in the folder for the notes here.

### Rulebooks
[[Daggerheart Core Rulebook\|Daggerheart Core Rulebook]]

### GM Tips
Since the system is new, all GMs will be new but some tips:
1. Make your [[Compendiums/Daggerheart Compendium/General/Fear Token\|Fear Token]] pool visible to your players on the table in some way shape or form regardless of if you are playing physically or online.
2. ***Avoid undermining Player Success:*** if a PC makes a Finesse roll in an attempt to move stealthily through a hallway, and they succeed with fear, don’t use your move to sound an alarm bell or make someone bump into them, spoiling their cover. Instead, consider options such as introducing a new obstacle at their target destination or adding a new enemy approaching from behind to complicate their situation.
