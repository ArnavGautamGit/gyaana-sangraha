# "AF" makes Japan lose WW2
During the [[The Second World War (WW2)\|Second World War]], (in spring of 1942) when USA was fighting Japan in the Pacific Ocean. American cryptanalysts had cracked some of the Japanese naval codes but they still couldn't trace some words that were used to refer to specific sites. One intercepted message told everyone that a major target is going to be a place named "AF". The suspected place was Midway Island but they couldnt be sure.

Commander Joseph Rochefort, head of U.S Navy's cryptography center at Pearl Harbor, devised a plan. he suspected AF means water. he asked the Naval group at Midway to send a message requesting Fresh Water becasue water distillary was damaged.

Soon USA intercepted a message that confirmed that AF meant water and sent it to Midway.
Rest is History.
