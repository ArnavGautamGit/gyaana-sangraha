# Classification of Digital Evidence
> In the Field of [[Digital Forensics\|Digital Forensics]], often [[Digital Evidences\|Digital Evidences]] are classified based on many factors including but not limited to Data Volatility and other factors.

In the subject [[Digital Forensics and Cyber Laws\|Digital Forensics and Cyber Laws]] taught to us during our College degree, we were only taught the Classification based on Data Storage Volatility.

### Based on Data Storage Volatility
- ***==Volatile==***: Data can disappear quickly. 
	- Example: [[Logic Gates\|Logic Gates]] and RAMs
- ***==Non-Volatile==***: Data remains stored on devices. 
	- Example: HDD, SSD etc.
- ***==Physical==***: Devices themselves that may contain data. 
	- Example: Smartwatches
