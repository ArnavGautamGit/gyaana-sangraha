# Ranger (DH)
> A [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/DH Character Creation#Character Class\|Character Class]] of a protector of the wilderness and their home forest. A brilliant Navigator seen most commonly wielding a bow - The Ranger in [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/Daggerheart\|Daggerheart]], similar to their [[Ranger (D&D)\|D&D equivalent]] is a useful ally to have as they are accustomed to fight without the support of an organised military, form great tacticians and use Guerilla Warfare at their finest.

Due to their knowledge of their home surroundings, a small group of rangers using their guerilla tactics can prove to be a nightmare for any invaders, no matter how many are there. Optimise by prioritising [[Agility\|Agility]].

### Background Questions
These help the players think about their character deeper or get a few points of thought to nudge them in the direction to aid character building. Choosing to answer these questions are completely optional:
- A terrible creature hurt your community, and you’ve vowed to hunt them down. What are they, and what unique trail or sign do they leave behind?
- Your first kill almost killed you, too. What was it, and what part of you was never the same after that event?
- You’ve traveled many dangerous lands, but what is the one place you refuse to go?

### Connections
These help you in case your party wants to have a premade set of connections between the party i.e, if you want the party to know each other before the campaign begins. Choosing to answer these questions is completely optional:
- What friendly competition do we have?
- Why do you act differently when we’re alone than when others are around?
- What threat have you asked me to watch for, and why are you worried about it?
