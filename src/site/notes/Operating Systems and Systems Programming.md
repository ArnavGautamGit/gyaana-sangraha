# Operating Systems and Systems Programming
> Subject taught in the 5th Semester of our Bachelor's of Technology Degree in the field of Computer Science Engineering from Jaypee Institute of Information Technology (JIIT), Noida.

Was taught by Prof. Ambalika Sarkar, the absolute weirdest professor you are going to find on campus who made the students sit according to their roll numbers like its a fricking exam. I was unable to concentrate as I would be at the back & unable to see shit because her handwriting is barely visible anyway.
