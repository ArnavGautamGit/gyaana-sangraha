# Armour, Weapons & Equipment
You equip weapons and armor to your character by recording them on your character sheet in the “Active Weapons” and “Active Armor” sections. Your character can only attack with weapons, benefit from armor, and gain features from items they have equipped.

## Weapons Statistics
Each Weapon has a Name, Trait, Range, Burden, Damage Dice and optionally may have a Feature.
There are only two Damage Types - Physical or Magical. Some may have resistance or immunity to certain damage types.

### Inventory Weapons
As your character acquires new equipment throughout their journey, they can carry two additional weapons (primary, secondary, or any combination of the two) in the “Inventory Weapon” areas of the character sheet, but there’s only so much room in your character’s pack. 

The inventory section holds gear your character doesn't have equipped, therefore your character isn't wielding these items and will not gain their benefits. This does not apply to armour since extra armour cannot be carried.

### Weapon Switching
When your character is in a dangerous situation, you can mark a Stress to equip an Inventory Weapon, moving their previous Active Weapon into the Inventory Weapon section.

If your character is in a calm situation or preparing during a rest, they can swap weapons with no Stress cost.

### Throwing your weapon
When you’re using a weapon that you could theoretically throw (such as a dagger or an axe), you can throw it at a target within [[Compendiums/Daggerheart Compendium/General/Maps, Range & Movement\|Very Close range]], making an attack roll using [[Finesse\|Finesse]]. 

On a success, deal damage as usual for that weapon. Once thrown, you lose that weapon. Unless you retrieve it, you can’t attack with it or benefit from its features.

> [!tip] Ammunition isn't counted unless "Special"
> It is assumed each character armed with a weapon that requires ammunition such as bows, crossbows and guns have ammunition in good supply and according to the specifications required by the weapon to fire properly.
> 
> If the game is designed to be gritty and grounded, then things such as food, ammo and its acquisition or consumption can be tracked but generally it is treated as an overhead to be avoided.

## Armour Statistics
Each Armour has a Name, Base Damage Thresholds and Base [[Compendiums/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Armour Score\|Armour Score]] which defines the number of [[Compendiums/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Armour Slots\|Armour Slots]] the Armour provides before it needs to be repaired. Additionally a piece of Armour may also grant a feature.

There are other forms of equipment such as shields which are counted as weapons but functionally act as armour - providing features that add [[Compendiums/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Armour Slots\|Armour Slots]] and such.

### Switching Armour
Your character can’t equip armour while in danger or under pressure. 
Otherwise, they can equip armor freely, replacing their previous active armour with armour they’ve purchased or otherwise acquired. 

Each armor has its own [[Compendiums/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Armour Slots\|Armour Slots]], as recorded in the boxes in that section; if your character switches armour, be sure to keep track of how many [[Compendiums/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Armour Slots\|Armour Slots]] you’ve marked on the old armour, especially if you are giving it to a party member. You can't carry additional armour in your inventory.

### Reducing Damage
One can reduce damage by using a maximum of 1x [[Compendiums/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Armour Slots\|Armour Slots]] per attack unless they have a feature to use more slots. 
Upon using Armour, they mark off one slot and incoming damage is reduced by one threshold such as from Severe to Major, from Major to Minor, from Minor to no damage.
Once all slots are used up, the character has to wait until downtime to repair their armour.

### Unarmoured
Going unarmored does not give your character any bonuses or penalties, but while unarmoured, they have an [[Compendiums/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Armour Score\|Armour Score]] of 0, their Major threshold is equal to their level, and their Severe threshold is equal to twice their level.

### Reflavouring Armour
As with weapons, class abilities, and domains, you can reflavor your character’s armour to suit them. A wizard using full plate armour might describe their protection as coming from heavily enchanted robes and protective rings, while their penalty to [[Compendiums/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Evasion Score\|Evasion Score]] and [[Agility\|Agility]] is due to the intense focus required to maintain such powerful protective magic.
