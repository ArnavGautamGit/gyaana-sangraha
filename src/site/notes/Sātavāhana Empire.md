# Sātavāhana Empire
> An empire in Central India which came to rise after the fall of the [[Mauryan Empire\|Mauryan Empire]]. It reached its maximum size and wealth under [[Gautamiputra Satakarni\|Gautamiputra Satakarni]].

The name "Sātavāhana" seems to mean "7 vehicles" in Sanskrit & Hindi and probably refers to "driven by 7" or "7 horses" all of which refers to how the Hindu God of the Sun, [[Sūrya (सूर्य)\|Sūrya (सूर्य)]] seems to have 7 horses pulling his chariot - where each horse represents one colour of the Spectrum of Light. The reason to have an association is probably to claim lineage from a dynasty which has produced warriors like [[Lord Rāma\|Lord Rāma]] and can assert a "divine right to rule".

### Major Rulers

They controlled the regions of present-day Vidarbha, Telangana, Maharashtra, Andhra & Karnataka with a good chunk of Madhya Pradesh & Chhattisgarh.

They had their capital in Pratisthana (Paithan, Maharashtra) and Amravati (capital of modern Telangana). They were also responsible for taking down the [[Kanvavamsha Dynasty\|Kanva Empire]] and ending the Dark Age of Central India as described in the following exerpt taken from the note in [[Mauryan Empire\|Mauryan Empire]]:

[[Later Mauryan Emperors\|Later Mauryan Emperors]] after the death of [[Ashoka\|Ashoka]] were too weak & soft, they could not lead as well. Due to none of the Mauryan Emperors being followers of [[Hinduism\|Hinduism]], it weakened their connect with the people - particularly the Brahmins. Eventually [[Pushyamitra Shunga\|Pushyamitra Shunga]] who was a Brahmin by caste decided to publically assassinate the last Mauryan Emperor named "Brihadratha" in 185 BC and takes the throne for himself to find the [[Shunga Dynasty\|Shunga Dynasty]] controlling the Northern Gangetic Plains and the Central Indian regions upto the shores of river Narmada to the south of which (including regions like the Andhras and Karnataka) were controlled by local fragmented tribal rulers which we don't know much about due to no [[Archaeological Evidence\|Archaeological]] or [[Literary Records\|Literary Records]] of the time known as the "Dark Age of Central India" until the [[Sātavāhana Empire\|Sātavāhana Empire]] rose a century later.

### Coinage & Contemporaries
They issued their own [[Kārṣāpaṇa Coins\|Kārṣāpaṇa Coins]] made of Lead & Potin.
***They were also at consistent war with the [[Western Kshatrapa\|Western Kshatrapa]]*** while the [[Northern Kshatrapa\|Northern Kshatrapa]] became a vassal of & merged with the [[Kushan Empire\|Kushan Empire]] meaning Sātvāhanas could not fight them due to not being rich enough & not having any ambitions of expanding northwards.

### Literary Mentions
The popular king named "Shalivahana" in Hindu, Jain and Buddhist Literature seems to be based on a Satvahana king. Their official court language was [[Prakrit\|Prakrit]] while [[Sanskrit\|Sanskrit]] and [[Maharashtri Prakrit\|Maharashtri Prakrit]] formed the major common languages of their kingdom. 

### Cultural Contributions
Many of the rock-cut sculptures in rock-cut temples of the [[Ellora Caves\|Ellora Caves]] and [[Ajanta Caves\|Ajanta Caves]], especially the [[Kailasa Temple in Ellora\|Kailasa Temple in Ellora]] were carved out of a single mountain & all of them were patronised by Sātavāhanas. Apart from the temple itself, many of the Mural Paintings found in the caves were patronised by the Sātavāhana Kings.
Culturally, the Queens & [[Queen-Mother\|Queen-Mothers]] of this dynasty patronised the construction of many edicts such as the [[Nāneghāt Inscription\|Nāneghāt Inscription]] patronised by [[Queen Naganika\|Queen Naganika]] along with the later [[Nāsik Inscription\|Nāsik Inscription]] patronised by [[Queen-Mother Gautami Belasari\|Queen-Mother Gautami Belasari]].
