# Markers of a Quality Whey Protein
To select a quality Whey protein check the Nutrition Label for 2 things:
1. ***==The Protein content (per 100 grams)==***:You should get a minimum of 75% (and a recommended of 80%) proteing per 100 grams i.e., for per 100 g, you should get at least 75-80 g of protein.
2. ***==The Amino Acid Profile==***: It should have around 10% Leucine. AT the very minimum it should be more than 7.5% per 100 grams

> ***==NOTE==***: Immediately reject any Whey Protein that fails to mention the amount of Leucine in the product or if it completely lacks a label that depicts the Amino Acid Profile.
