# My Two Cents on Indian Divorce Laws
> This Note/Page contains my views on Divorce Laws in India.

### Regarding Alimony exclusively to Wife
The Indian Courts claim the wives become habitual of a particular standard of living in their matrimonial home & hence are liable for alimony for the remainder of their lives from their Husbands (now *ex-Husbands*)

Why does the court want the ex-wife to enjoy the same standard of living as she did before? So that the ex-wife can live with all the benefits of marriage but without any responsibility of the same? 

Why should one get the benefits and pros of marriage (here, standard of living) without its responsibilities and cons it comes with... and if they decide they no longer want the responsibilities of marriage why should they continue to get its benefits?

Isn't the Apex Court trying to control and expect too much of society to govern how the people should live or celebrate their festivals? This sounds very Authoritarian when the Hon'ble Judges/Justices themselves claim to be Libertarian and Progressive?
