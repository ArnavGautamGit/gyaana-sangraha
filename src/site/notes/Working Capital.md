# Working Capital
> Also called as "Circulating Capital" or "Operating Capital", it is the sum of [[Asset\|Assets]] and Money required to keep the business running and the production continuing smoothly month after month & year after year.

Working Capital is needed particularly in the recurring acquisition of raw material, in payment of salaries. It is primarily obtained from [[EBITDA\|Operating Profit]] earned by the business as it sells more units of the product or service.
