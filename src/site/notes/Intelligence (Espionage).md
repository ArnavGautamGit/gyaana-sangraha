# Intelligence (Espionage)

[[MOSSAD\|MOSSAD]]'s former chief has once defined Intelligence as:
> "Intelligence is not a science, certainly not a natural science. It is an art or a craft, and such it cannot be governed by the basic tenets of logic"
> ~ to *The Economist* as mentioned in the article titled: [In Defence of the Intelligence Services](https://econ.st/2GZn9An)

In the worlds of former [[R&AW\|R&AW]] chief, Vikram Sood,
> "Intelligence is that secret activity conducted at the behest of the government that provides it with advance knowledge to take suitable decisions relating to the security of a nation and national interests."
> ~ The Unending Game, Page 5.

In my words - according to what I have studied, Intelligence is the secret collection of any kind of data, information and experiences which helps the government to take actions against any threats against any nation regardless of if the threat is internal or external.

# Why Intelligence is collected?
Basic Purpose of collecting intelligence is to keep a know-how of what is happening around us and that no threat comes as a surprise to the government. In addition, it is preferred if the Government is able to have advanced knowledge of how to deal with the said threat.

Intelligence is collected by specific agencies on the behalf of the government. It is imperitive to note that certain countries may have separate agencies for internal and external threats, while other countries may not.

The agency may itself become a threat if it starts to take independent decisions about which government is better or which person should become the next PM/President.

# Desirable form of Intelligence - Strategic Intel
Intelligence must be Strategic - it should be able to give us (or be related to) information which can be used to formulate & implement a strategy in defence of a threat - not just notify us of a threat.
It must be comprehensive, covering all sources - including [[Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT)\|Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT)]]
Enemy capacity, intentions and objectives are the most prime intelligence.
