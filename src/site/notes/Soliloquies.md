# Soliloquies
> Coined by [[Saint Augustine\|Saint Augustine]] using 2 Latin Words "solo" (alone) and "loqui" (talking).
> It is a way of introspection by the method of writing/speaking to yourself the answers to your problems as you think while writing/speaking. Answering one question that pops up after another. A book which contain the sililoquies of someone is called their "Book of Soliloquies".

Historically, Philosophers in [[Ancient Greece\|Ancient Greece]] would create another character and write their Soliloquies as conversation between themselves and that character - which would represent the voice of reason. 

I write Soliloquies in my Green Diary made of Handmade Paper although unlike the Greek Philosophers, I have not yet created any other "character" of any kind.

I have written and digitised some of my Soliloquies in [[My Book of Soliloquies\|My Book of Soliloquies]].
