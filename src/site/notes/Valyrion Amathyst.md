# Valyrion Amathyst - D&D Character
***==Personality==***: 
Happy, Inquisitive, Curious, Talkative. Loves to make friends by knowing more about them.

***==Backstory==***:
I was a regular old Wood Elf with an Eagle Companion...
That was until a month ago when I was out hunting with my frineds since we had an intelligence input that there is a spotting of a creature that can feed a family for all 3 meals! Quickly the tribe's rangers and fighters scattered to find the creature, hopefully in multiples so that the entire tribe can be fed. We ventured far away from home when we saw a Shadar Kai standing on top of a stack of 3 such massive sized super deers... *looking at us*.
My friend... Ryu approached him and he teleported! He teleported right behind Ryu and stabbed him through his chest from behind.
Lita, his girlfriend tried to attack him but we one sweep swing of his sword he took her head clean off.
I felt scared to my bones. I tried to pull out an arrow from my quiver but was kicked right in my sternum when I flew a few feet. I realised fighting is no use, So I started running. Back home. Now I feel it was a stupid idea but either way, he wouldn't be able to catchup with me anyway, but started shopting arrows with dead-eye accuracy, most didn't catch my body due to me being a rapidly moving target while him trying to follow me. I was only caught by one shot to my left leg. Which made me fall from the tree to the ground on my back. The pain was excruciating enough that I couldn't move. My Familiar Eagle - Vayu pitched down to attack the unknown Shadar Kai but the Shadar Kai's sword cut Vayu in clean two pieces...
Something in me changed... I felt fire from the pit of my stomach...
My body had gained an ability almost. As the rage took over, I saw a ring of fire around my wrists. I leaped towards the Shadar Kai and punched him straight in the jaw and he flew FAR! Everything he touched through his air time caught fire... I saw atleast 10 trees on fire in the straight line of sight but didn't get phased, almost conpletely taken over by bloodlust, rage and vengeance.
Some trees felt over and there he stood, the invader Shadar Kai.
He just won't give up will he?
All I remembered after the fight is that I was in the middle of my own tribe's home trees... or their remains at least... with only burnt trees, burnt bodies and burnt food in sight.
My attention quickly gained by a voice crying and shouting... The Shadar Kai's torso in my feet... burning. Missing both arms and legs... with shards of his own sword burried in his torso almost uniformly.
I looked around to see I burnt the entire forest.
No one was alive. I vowed I will never use this side of me ever again unless I learn gow to control it. By extension, try to be averse of friendships... Till my Journey to these lands, I have aquired some equipment to make things easier. Some call me a Sorcerer, I was originally a ranger, I prefer to call myself by my name"

Spells thought for future:
1. ***==Pass Without Trace==***: Allows even a clunky Paladin in your team to get a plus 10 in Stealth. Unlocks as a level 2 spell at Levels 5 and 7.
2. ***==Spike Growth==***: Allows the Ranger to grow Spikes in the ground as a trap. 20ft in radius, any creature willing to travel through would be taking 2d4 damage for every 5 feet, i.e., 16d4 damage if they decide to go through it. If a creature does not see you cast that spell, they don't know its there. Its Naturally Camouflaged
3. ***==Summon Beasts==***: If you have a pet, your pet gets a pet. If not, then it is pretty amazing, still.
4. ***==Conjure Animals==***: Spawns Animals (even cows) that can absolutely outdamage the team every single round. Unlike the previous ones, this spell spawns animals in packs like a pack of Wolves, a group of elks or just 1 massive bear!
