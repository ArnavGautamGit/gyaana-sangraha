# Footnotes
1. ***Ahmadi Community*** (also sometimes "Ahmedi" or "Ahmadiya" and other spelling variations) are a caste (firka) of Muslims found in the Indian Subcontinent and surrounding regions. They can be considered as a third "sub-community" (for the lack of a better word) after Shia and Sunni muslims.
