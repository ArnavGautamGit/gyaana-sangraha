# D&D Player's Handbook (2024)
> The [[Compendiums/D&D Compendium/Dungeons & Dragons\|D&D]] Rulebook to function as Player's Guide to creating characters and navigating adventures among other tasks.

This note is about the 2024 update to the 5th Edition which is also popularly called "5.5e" or D&D 2024. The free [[System Requirements Document (SRD)\|SRD]] names it 5.2e for some reason. 

The Original 2014 rules are now called as "Legacy" even by D&D Beyond and I am going to be skipping the original 2014 rules completely since even Critical Role is going to run the 2024 rules.
I have a few adventures that were never updated, so I will update them as I see fit.

### Map of Content
Any Handbook aims to make the experience simpler - the D&D PHB is no different.
In a Player's Handbook, you would have the rules for the players side of things and hence the entire handbook can be divided into 3 sections - also noted by the publishers.

Section 1: Basic Rules
[[D&D d20 Tests\|D&D d20 Tests]]
[[D&D Heroic Inspiration\|D&D Heroic Inspiration]]
[[Skill Proficiency (D&D)\|Skill Proficiency (D&D)]]
[[D&D Action Rules\|D&D Action Rules]]
[[D&D Exploration Rules\|D&D Exploration Rules]]
[[D&D Combat Rules\|D&D Combat Rules]]
[[D&D Damage & Healing Rules\|D&D Damage & Healing Rules]]
[[D&D Conditions\|D&D Conditions]]

Section 2: Character Creation Rules (Chapters 3-4)
[[D&D Character Creation\|D&D Character Creation]] - particularly [[D&D Character Classes\|Class]], [[D&D Character Backgrounds\|Background]] & [[Compendiums/D&D Compendium/Player/Ancestries/D&D Ancestries\|Ancestry]]
[[D&D Multiclassing Rules\|D&D Multiclassing Rules]]

Section 3: Character Abilities & Spells
[[D&D Character Feats\|D&D Character Feats]] (Chapter 5)
[[D&D Adventuring Equipment, Tools & Gear\|D&D Adventuring Equipment, Tools & Gear]] (Chapter 6)
[[D&D Spell List\|D&D Spell List]] (Chapter 7)

There are then some appendices on Creature Stat Blocks for a few adversaries, Multiverse and the Rules Glossary but not something which is particularly amazing or useful apart from the last one (Rules Glossary or Appendix C) which can come in handy sometimes, I suppose.
