# Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW)
> Advanced [[Firewall\|Firewall]] that can better protect assets. Generally Network-based Firewalls which are made as hardware devices that can eaily plug in to the network. [[Data Packets\|Data Packets]] can be blocked with greater precision.
 
This upgrade over the classic firewall has stateful scanning capabilities i.e., it can scan even inside the packets. Previous Firewalls could only scan and see the packet type - UDP, TCP etc. NGFW can see the individual flags of the packet and compare from a table whether a particular flag on a particular packet type is allowed or not.

Being able to see the flags on a packet means being able to see the type of communication and estimate whether the TCP packet is genuine or is this a part of a TCP Scan using the SYN packets.
