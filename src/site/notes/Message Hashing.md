# Message Hashing
> A process of passing the sent/received message through a [[Hashing\|Hashing]] function which converts the mesage into a hash (preferably on the sending/receiving device itself).

The hashes are then compared to check if the message [[Integrity\|Integrity]] has not been compromised. It verifies that the message sent is the message received.
