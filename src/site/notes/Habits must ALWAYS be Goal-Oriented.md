# Habits must ALWAYS be Goal-Oriented
The book *"[[Books Library/Habit Stacking\|Habit Stacking]]"* by SJ Scott is a great book where I first learnt of this idea.

It is importnant to note that why the word "always" is used and that too in capital since the negation of the statement, if implemented in anyone's life, it will surely spell in DISASTER. The Negation being that the Habits one has must never be inline with their goals which is going to mean (by extension) that their habits are not habits - rather can be equated with an addiction to distractions.

## What is a Goal?
The Answer to which is simpler than the question itself. A goal is something you want to achieve in any sphere of life - whatever it may be. Our habits must always take us there.
Goals can be of many kinds:
1. Career Goals
2. Finance Goals
3. Health Goals
4. Leisure Goals
5. Organisation Goals
6. Relationship Goals
7. Spirituality Goals

I do not think I need to expand on any of the above since they are well understood anyway.

## How to Identify a Goal?
Simple. If you wish to do something in some field/sphere of life, you have a goal. Note that there can be more spheres of lifde you dedicate goals to except these ones given above.
The wish becomes a goal when it is long term and there is an actual passion behind it. Not any wish is a goal but every goal was once a wish. 
***Example***: The process of going from "I wish I was a good student" to "My goal is to be a good student" is the process of identifying and setting a goal.

## 12 Questions to ask to figure out your habits
1. *Is there a small habit that can support a bigger one?* Like preparing the gym bag in the morning for going to the gym in the evening.
2. *Do I often end the day frustrated since I could not finish all my tasks of the day?*
3. *What **quick** activity makes me happy or inspired?*
4. *What five goals are the most important to me?*
5. *What activities that I love to do?*
6. *What areas of my financial life can I improve?*
7. *Can I improve the quality of my interpersonal relationships?*
8. *What makes me feel great about myself?*
9. *How can I become more spiritual in life?*
10. *What is a skill I wanted to master?*
11. *Is there anything I can do to support my local community or important cause?*
12. *Is there something that I can do improve my day job performance and get a raise?*
