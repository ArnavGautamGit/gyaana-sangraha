# Bangladesh
> [[State (United Nations)\|UN Member State]] on the east of [[India\|India]] surrounded by the India on three sides from West, North and East while [[Bay of Bengal\|Bay of Bengal]] on the south.

Bangladesh has Tripura and Mizoram to its east, Meghalaya to its North and West Bengal to its west. Among all the neighbours, only West Bengal has a population that speaks [[Bengali\|Bengali]] although accents are different & easily discernable by a person who speaks Bengali natively.

Bangladesh is the final frontier of the [[Ganga-Brahmaputra-Barak River System\|Ganga-Brahmaputra-Barak River System]] but there may be more developments soon since both the [[Ganga Water Treaty (1996-2026)\|Ganga Water Treaty]] and the [[Teesta Water Treaty\|Teesta Water Treaty]] are expiring next year in 2026. They recently underwent a [[Bangladeshi Regime Change (2024)\|Regime Change in 2024]] powered by the Bangladeshi Student Protest.

### Bangladeshi History in brief
Bangladesh (then East Bengal) was partioned into Pakistan due to having a sizable muslim population & mainland Pakistanis were racially abusive towards the Benaglis of East Bengal due to the latter having shorter heights, smaller build and darker complexion. Bengalis were subjugated until [[Sheikh Mujib-Ur-Rahman\|Sheikh Mujib-Ur-Rahman]] was able to win the general elections for the position of Pakistani PM across both East & West (i.e. mainland) Pakistan and declared the East Pakistani territory as an independent country of Bangladesh in May 1971. 

Rahman was arrested on charges of treason & Pakistani generals started the racial extermination of Bengalis under [[Operation Searchlight (1970-1971)\|Operation Searchlight (1970-1971)]] where 3 million women of bengali descent were raped & 3-5 million Bengali children and men killed in order to "change the genetics" of Bengalis as certain Pakistani generals claimed.

Millions of Bengalis fled to India & this is how India got involved. 
India's [[R&AW\|R&AW]] started training a Bangla rebel group named [[Mukti Bahini\|Mukti Bahini]] which would act to internally attack key locations and cause armed insurgency but they were still no match for an organised military due to a lack of naval & air power. 

On 3rd December 1971, Pakistan attacked Indian Air Bases in Kashmir, Delhi, Rajasthan and Western UP and trigerred the [[3rd India-Pakistan War (1971)\|3rd India-Pakistan War (1971)]] before India could. Pakistan was made to surrender, along with 93,000 Pakistani soldiers as Prisoners of War. This was the largest military surrender after [[The Second World War (WW2)\|The Second World War (WW2)]].

### Change in Tunes
Although it was not the case before, but Bangladesh has recently been extremely Anti-India and racist towards Indians since [[Bangladeshi Regime Change (2024)\|Bangladeshi Regime Change (2024)]] despite India being the country that saved Bangladeshis from the Pakistani plan to commit "racial extermination" (as admitted by Pakistani generals) under [[Operation Searchlight (1970-1971)\|Operation Searchlight (1970-1971)]]. 

Bangladesh easily forgot the Indian Soldiers who sacrificed themselves for Bangladeshi commoners in [[3rd India-Pakistan War (1971)\|3rd India-Pakistan War (1971)]] especially when they were supporting many radical groups peddling the ideas of creating a "[[Greater Bangladesh\|Greater Bangladesh]]" by capturing Indian Territory.
