# Initiative Roll
> A rule to signify the start of combat and identify turn order for combat engagements in [[Table-Top Role-Playing Game\|TTRPGs]] like [[Compendiums/D&D Compendium/Dungeons & Dragons\|D&D]] and [[Pathfinder 2e\|Pathfinder 2e]].

Initiative determines the order of turns during combat. When combat starts, every participant rolls Initiative by making a Dexterity check that determines their place in the Initiative order. The [[Dungeon Master (DM)\|DM]] rolls for Adversaries. For a group of identical creatures, the [[Dungeon Master (DM)\|DM]] makes a single roll, so each member of the group has the same Initiative.

There are a few conditions where the Initiative Roll is affected by the narrative:
- If one of the parties are caught by ***Surprise***, there is a disadvantage on that party's Initiative roll.
- Ties are sorted by the [[Dungeon Master (DM)\|DM]] and the players depending upon whether the tie is between two Adversaries or PCs respectively. If the tie is between an adversary/monster and a PC then the DM decides (generally by trying to balance the encounter by keeping equal number of PCs who go before and after the adversaries)
