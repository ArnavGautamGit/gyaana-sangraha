# Fundamental Attribution Error
> Tendency to ignore other factors and pin all the responsibility on just one factor in an unconscious effort of simplification.
 
> ***Example***: "Hitler is singlehandedly responsible for WW2" He holds a good chunk of responsibility but it was the oversight and inaction of the Allies who ignored the steady rise in the Military Strength of Germany since the 1930s.

It is a special kind of [[False Causality\|False Causality]] generally caused by [[Hindsight Bias\|Hindsight Bias]]. 
One will have to avoid Hindsight Bias to avoid making sweeping Oversimplifications.
