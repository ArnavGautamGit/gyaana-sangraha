# Good & Evil in Hinduism
Good & Evil occur over and over in [[Hinduism\|Hinduism]] along with [[Dharma (धर्म)\|Dharma (धर्म)]], [[Karma (कर्म)\|Karma (कर्म)]] and related concepts.

What I was able to understand is that due to their ruthlessness, resourcefulness and being open to breaking societal norms & rules such as codes and rules of war, evil people think very differently and hence amass power in the short run and then the power corrupts them & they become arrogant. This happened with Raavana, Duryodhana and other such powerful villains in the epics like [[Rāmāyaṇa\|Rāmāyaṇa]] and [[Books Library/Mahābhārata\|Mahābhārata]] or [[Purāṇa\|Purāṇa]] (such as the [[Shrimad-Bhagavad Purāṇa\|Shrimad-Bhagavad Purāṇa]] having Kansa as the villain).

With Arrogance, one becomes ignorant - with ignorance one makes foolish choices and decisions and eventually you make a downward spiral just as fast as you made an upward climb.

What the religion tries to teach us is that good forever stays while evil rises and falls in cycles.
Evil people are often also remembered for the reason of being conquered by a good person such as Raavan being remembered due to being an evil person killed by Shri Rāma.
