# Correlation Coefficient
> Mathematical ratio of Correlation between two axes on a Plotted Graph.

Each measurement is taken and plotted as a point on a graph with x and y axes.
These points are then taken to find if there is some coreelation between the two fields that the axes represent.

### Positive & Negative Correlation
Correlation Coefficient goes from a value of -1 to a value of +1 
Exact -1 value would mean that increase in one variable results in a precise & predictable decrease in the other variable in the same ratio as the coefficient. 

Whereas an exact +1 value of Correlation would mean that increase in one variable results in a precise & predictable decrease in the other variable in the same ratio as the coefficient.

A correlation of zero meand no relationship between the two.
A correlation of anything in between means correlation exists with some randomness which is different than the norm. These are called [[Outliers\|Outliers]].

### Variation
It is similar to [[Standard Deviation & Variance\|Standard Deviation & Variance]] where $\large(\sigma)^2$ is used to find variance.
Here finding the square of the Coefficient gives us
