# Repair not Blame
> A mental habit proposed in [[Attack Mode\|Attack Mode]] which proposes that whenever we find ourselves blaming something or someone for our current situation, we pull ourselves back to see what all we can repair and salvage from this situation we are in.

The show must go on. 
You cannot stop trying to do better & busy yourself blaming your College or your Boss or anyone else you encounter.
Take a step back, Introspect and Self-Reflect on what we can do to bounce back from the current situation.
