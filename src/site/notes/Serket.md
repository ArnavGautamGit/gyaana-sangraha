# Serket
Quinn & Serket first met in the Coruscant Jedi Temple, when Serket was sitting on a rock looking at leaves falling from trees while Quinn was in an melancholy mood.
She helped him cheer up about the fact that its okay to miss home once in a while.

About Serket:
- Cathar
- Dyed hair to pink
- Dresses casually
- Likes to operate in the shadows
- Flaunts her lightsaber while in friendly territory - generally uses her dagger elsewhere unless cover is blown.
