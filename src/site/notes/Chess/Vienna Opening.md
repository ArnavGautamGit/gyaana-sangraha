# Vienna Opening
> A [[Chess Opening with White Pieces\|Chess Opening with White Pieces]] that is often regarded a quite unique opening in [[Chess/Chess\|Chess]] that hides the player's skill behind an illusion of being defensive. 

Vienna reflects the mentality of Counter-Attacking with a great poise. The player with the White Pieces who plays the opening plays their Knight to the F3 square. It is a greatly common defensive move.

I have already mentioned this on my note on Chess but I will mention it again:

The opening starts with White's pawn to e4, black's pawn to e5 (1. e4 e5) 
and then a Knight to c3. Generally opponents playing with black respond with Knight to f6 or c6. Both these variations are called the Vienna Gambit and Vienna Game respectively.

Both variations are shown one after the other using a navigation-enabled Obsidian Chess Study plugin below. Starting with Variation 1 for Vienna Gambit:

Similarly, if the Black plays Nc6 as a response to Nc3, you can play the Bishop to c4. There are two further variations possible from here. 
Either: (a) they try to copy our move with their Bishop to c5

or: (b) they bring their other knight out to attack our pawn again
