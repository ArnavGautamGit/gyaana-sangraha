# The Elven Confederacy
> Confederacy of all kingdoms running on majority elven population regardless of if the ruling family are elves or not - although the former is true for 90-95% of the kingdoms. 
> 
> Being a member of the confederacy grants 0% import taxes and open borders and trade relations. Free from tax and licensing. It also grants dual-currency - currency of the kingdoms and a common currency both being accepted forms of payment.

Confederacy is opt-in. Any confederate member could drop out but they would risk isolation since the other members would levy them great taxes and treat them as an outsider. Although those with the rulers are non-elf - they feel less association.

The confederacy was formed to protect themselves against the [[Miragerie\|Miragerie]] and the confederacy began adding kingdoms right when the Miragerie started unifying.
