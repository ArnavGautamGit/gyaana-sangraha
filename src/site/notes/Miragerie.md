# Miragerie
> A tribal syndicate originating in the [[Great Orc Desert\|Great Orc Desert]] comprised of a collection of tribes comprising of Orcs & Goblins which have begun attacking & colonising different areas. 

Their name is a concatenation of the words Mirage & Menagerie showcasing their desert roots and their barbaric acts. Not all Orcs or Goblins are allied with them but many are.

Whenever they colonise, they merge the local criminal syndicates & bandit overlords using their own greed & hunger for power against them. They later use advanced magick or some other method to convert the captured lands to deserts.

Their Capital is not singular or fixed, since they (at their core) are a collection of tribes who have their own capitals.

They have a few bases in [[Forever Dark\|Forever Dark]], which they use to send their criminals if they are to be exiled instead of becoming dinner or if the criminal cannot be eaten because of the criminal also being Orc or Goblin.
