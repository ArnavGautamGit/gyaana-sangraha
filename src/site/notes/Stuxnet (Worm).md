# Stuxnet (Worm)
*Stuxnet* is a malicious computer worm first uncovered in 2010 and thought to have been in development since at least 2005. Stuxnet targets ==S==upervisory ==C==ontrol and ==D==ata ==A==cquisition ( also called as [SCADA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCADA "SCADA")) systems and is believed to be responsible for causing substantial damage to the [[Iranian Nuclear Program\|Iranian Nuclear Program]]. Although neither country has openly admitted responsibility, the worm is widely understood to be a [cyberweapon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberweapon "Cyberweapon")developed jointly by the United States and Israel in a collaborative effort known as [Operation Olympic Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Olympic_Games "Operation Olympic Games"). The program, started during the Bush administration, was rapidly expanded within the first months of Barack Obama's presidency.

Stuxnet specifically targets [programmable logic controllers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmable_logic_controller "Programmable logic controller") (PLCs), which allow the automation of electromechanical processes such as those used to control machinery and industrial processes including gas centrifuges for separating nuclear material.

Stuxnet used FOUR Zero-Day flaws and targeted Microsoft Windows software and then traced Siemens Step7 software. This worm reportedly compromised one-fifth of all Iranian PLCs, collecting information on industrial systems and causing the fast-spinning centrifuges to tear themselves apart. Targeting industrial control systems, the worm infected over 200,000 computers and caused 1,000 machines to physically degrade.

Stuxnet has three modules: 
- A [worm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_worm "Computer worm") that executes all routines related to the main payload of the attack; 
- A [link file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_shortcut "File shortcut") that automatically executes the propagated copies of the worm; 
- A [[Rootkit (Malware)\|rootkit]] component responsible for hiding all malicious files and processes, to prevent detection of Stuxnet.

In May 2011, The PBS program '*Need to Know*' cited a statement of Gary Samore, White House Coordinator for Arms Control and Weapons of Mass Destruction, in which he had explicitly said, "we're glad they (the Iranians) are having trouble with their centrifuge machine and that we – the U.S. and its allies – are doing everything we can to make sure that we complicate matters for them,". The Original Statement is available [here](https://www.pbs.org/wnet/need-to-know/security/video-cracking-the-code-defending-against-the-superweapons-of-the-21st-century-cyberwar/9456/) (skip to the 4th minute)

In the Retirment Party for the head of Isreali Defense Forces (Gabi Ashkenazi), a showreel showing his service life's biggest achievements also included references to Stuxnet. (It was showcased by *The Daily Telegraph* [here](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/israel/8326387/Israel-video-shows-Stuxnet-as-one-of-its-successes.html))

A study of the spread of Stuxnet by showed that the main affected countries in the early days of the infection were Iran, Indonesia and India:

| Country         | Share of infected computers |
| --------------- | --------------------------- |
| Iran            | 58.9%                       |
| Indonesia       | 18.2%                       |
| India           | 8.3%                        |
| Azerbaijan      | 2.6%                        |
| United States   | 1.6%                        |
| Pakistan        | 1.3%                        |
| Other countries | 9.2%                        |

Iran was reported to have "beefed up" its cyberwar abilities following the Stuxnet attack, and has been suspected of retaliatory attacks against United States banks in [Operation Ababil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Ababil "Operation Ababil") (although it was not as successful).
