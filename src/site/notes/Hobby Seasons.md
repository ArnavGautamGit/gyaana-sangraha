# Hobby Seasons
> A Concept proposed by a YouTuber named Odysseas ([[Hobby Seasons#^1\|#^1]]) who says that one should pick one or two hobbies at a time and leave the rest for later, to pick up according to our Human Energy Levels. If you are tired, don't pick a Physical Hobby, pick a relaxing Social or Artistic Hobby. 

Hobby Categories like Physical Hobbies, Artistic Hobbies etc. are discussed in the note named - "[[Four Hobbies of a Renaissance Man\|Four Hobbies of a Renaissance Man]]".

### Logistics
If one can choose only one or two hobbies, that means I only develop certain parts of my personality at a time. So, if I am busy with College or School, I can pick my two hobbies to be Social and Artistic kinds since my Physical and Mental spheres are getting enough stimulation (may be different for different students).
