# Profit-before-Tax (PBT)
> Also called "Earnings before Tax", it is defined as the Net Profit earned by a business after paying for all the [[Interest\|Interest]] (Loan Repayments) and claiming [[Depreciation\|Depreciation]]. All that is left is paying [[Corporate Tax\|Corporate Tax]].

PBT is calculated from [[EBITDA\|EBITDA]] using the following formulae.
$$\Large \text{EBITDA} = \text{Gross Margin} - \text{Other Costs}$$
$$\Large \text{PBT} = \text{EBITDA} - \text{Interest} - \text{Depreciation}$$
Here the term [[Interest\|Interest]] refers to Debt EMIs paid in that timeframe during which PBT is being calculated (like Monthly or quarterly PBT as example would use the total money paid as EMIs in that month or quarter)

### How are certain companies loss-making but EBITDA positive?
Many businesses are profitable at EBDT or [[EBITDA\|EBITDA]] but loss-making at PBT. This is because you can claim Depreciation as savings for repair of the assets the company owns, you do not actually pay them but one day you will use this money to replace your machines and repair your factory.
