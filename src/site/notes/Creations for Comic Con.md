# Creations for Comic Con
> A note compiling what I learned trying to figure what sells & how much in a Comic Con incase I wish to set up a table at [[Comic Con Delhi 2025\|Comic Con Delhi 2025]] or any other future comic con in another location as well.

The First thing we learnt is that we need to know the following things from the Organisers of the convention:
1. What the average table looks like?
2. What is the size of the table?
3. Can we hang stuff behind us? (any booth space?)
4. Is Fan Art allowed? How much? (Fan Art sells more)

The Following things we need to ask ourselves:
1. What are we selling?
	1. Always sell some pricey items (Books, Apparel, Art) and some comparitively affordable items (Pin-up Buttons, Stickers, Bookmarks).
	2. After we have confirmed if Fan Art is allowed,
		1. If Fan Art is allowed, then keep some Fan Art of famous IPs
		2. If Fan Art isn't allowed at all, then no point even setting up shop unless you have a personal IP (like a comic book series) to advertise.
2. What is my Budget?
	1. What is the minimum I can invest?
		1. Items that are easy or cheap to manufacture
		2. Stock for each item is between 5-15.
	2. What do I expect to make?
		1. How much do you expect to sell?

### Product Ideas
1. Some copies of a book based on Homebrew Campaign Setting for TTRPGs.
2. Stickers and Bobby Pins (also called Pin-ups or Buttons).
