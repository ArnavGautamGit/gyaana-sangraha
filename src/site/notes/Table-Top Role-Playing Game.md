# Table-Top Role-Playing Game
> A genre of RPG games played on pen & paper with a group of people sitting around a table. This note lists all the knowledge I have on them.

TTRPGs like [[Compendiums/D&D Compendium/Dungeons & Dragons\|Dungeons & Dragons]] are responsible for the creation of literally every RPG videogame you have played from The Witcher series to Legends of Zelda and even Dark Souls.

Some Popular TTRPG Systems:
[[Compendiums/Daggerheart Compendium/Daggerheart\|Daggerheart]]
[[Compendiums/D&D Compendium/Dungeons & Dragons\|Dungeons & Dragons]] (learning)
[[Pathfinder 2e\|Pathfinder 2e]] (yet to learn)
[[Shadowdark\|Shadowdark]]
[[DC20\|DC20]]

I host TTRPG games part-time on StartPlaying Games and you can find my profile [here](https://www.startplaying.games/gm/arnav)
I often use Owlbear Rodeo and sometimes use Roll20 (as a player) but to be honest, I am more comfortable with Owlbear Rodeo than anything else.
