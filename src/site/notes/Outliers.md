# Outliers
> Readings or Characteristics that are extremes away from the normal [[Correlation Coefficient\|Correlation Coefficient]] of the two or more fields that is being talked about in context.

Outliers are extremely rare for the same reason that they are like a shot of randomness that is away from norm and for something to have such characteristics that are random and away from the norm has very few probabilistic chances.
