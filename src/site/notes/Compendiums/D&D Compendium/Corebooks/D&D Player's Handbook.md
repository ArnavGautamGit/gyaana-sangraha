# D&D Player's Handbook (2024)
> The [[Compendiums/D&D Compendium/Dungeons & Dragons\|D&D]] Rulebook to function as Player's Guide to creating characters and navigating adventures among other tasks.

This note is about the 2024 update to the 5th Edition which is also popularly called "5.5e" or D&D 2024. The free [[System Requirements Document (SRD)\|SRD]] names it 5.2e for some reason. 

The Original 2014 rules are now called as "Legacy" even by D&D Beyond and I am going to be skipping the original 2014 rules completely since even Critical Role is going to run the 2024 rules.
I have a few adventures that were never updated, so I will update them as I see fit.
