# Vibration Mode of Molecules
> When molecules have excess energy, they vibrate in modes defined by their structure - the [[Bond Length\|Bond Length]], [[Bond Angle\|Bond Angle]], Atoms involved in bonding and their size.

Mainly there are 3 types of Vibration Modes:
1. Symmetric Stretch
2. Asymmetric Stretch
3. Bend (also called Scissoring)

A molecule with $\large N$ atoms, if non-linear has $\large3N-6$ modes of vibration whereas if it is linear, it has $\large3N-5$ modes of vibration.

## Vibration Modes - why study them?
Vibration Modes help understand which molecules are [[Infrared Activity\|IR Active]] and which are not.
