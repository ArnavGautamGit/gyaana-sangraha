# Infrared Activity
> Infrared Activity is a measure of how much Infrared Radiation does an atmospheric atom absorb. Atoms that are Infrared Inactive do not absorb Infrared Radiation

In [[Climate Modelling\|Climate Modelling]], Infrared Activity or IR Activity is important since Infrared carries majority of sun's heat meaning IR Active molecules contribute to [[Climate Change\|Climate Change]] whereas other molecules do not. 

Although some Infrared Active molecules are needed - since without them the Earth will remain cold and frozen and probably will never get proper temperatures to support life. Some Essential IR Active molecules include [[Ozone\|Ozone]] and Water Vapour ($\large H_2O$).

Infrared Active Elements that are unessential should be kept in check - like Carbon Dioxide ($\large CO_2$).
