## Work Experience
- *Software Intern @ AventIQ* ---> May 2025 to Aug 2025
	- Worked on upgrading and maintaining legacy projects built on [[Angular (Framework)\|Angular v13]], [[Dotnet (.NET)\|.NET]] and [[PostgreSQL\|PostgreSQL]].
	- Practiced and Learnt about Secure Coding practices practically as we made secure internal clones of the projects.
- *Software & Security Intern @ Accuvance India* ---> Dec 2024 to Jan 2025
	- Developed a ***Minimum Viable Product (MVP)*** of ***AccuStraw AI***, an AI-powered genetic straw counting system using image recognition and machine learning, enhancing safety and efficiency in cryogenic environments.
	- Integrated Short Wave Infrared (SWIR) imaging to detect and count straws stored in liquid nitrogen (-196°C), ***overcoming visibility challenges caused by vapor interference***.
	- Delivered a precision-focused solution enabling real-time operator feedback and error correction, reducing risk of death due to prolonged contact with Liquid Nitrogen (as its vapours replaces Oxygen in blood).

## Personal Projects
- [ज्ञानसंग्रह - Personal Knowledge Repository](https://github.com/ArnavGautamGit/gyaana-sangraha) ---> 25 May 2025
	- Designed a website using  [[EleventyJS\|EleventyJS]] to host all my major, non-personal notes that I make on Obsidian so I could learn in public & share my knowledge.
	- Used a community plugin for Obsidian to backup my public notes to the "notes" subfolder of a [Specific GitHub Repo](https://github.com/ArnavGautamGit/gyaana-sangraha) and deployed the website on Netlify.
	- Each note in "notes" subfolder is automatically wrapped into JS and SCSS to add to this very website you are viewing this Resume on.
	- At each update, Netlify automatically deploys the latest commit.
- [CyberCheck - Cyber Security Toolkit](https://github.com/AshwathiNair08/CyberCheck-Vulnerability-Scanning-Toolkit) ---> Sept 2024 to May 2025
	- Designed a Python-based Cyber Security Toolkit for Cyber Security professionals who wish to check the security level of their services and networks.
	- The toolkit enables the users to protect against Footprinting & Reconnaissance as it comes equipped with Nmap, WhoisLookup, DNSLookup commands which can be run directly from the terminal.
	- The toolkit also comes pre-equipped with Network Scanning and Network Security tools such as Traceroute and MTR which produces Network Diagrams using Python Library ’matplotlib’ and a VirusTotal API.
- [FitRaho - Fitness App](https://github.com/ArnavGautamGit/FitRaho-Fitness-App) ---> Feb 2024 to May 2024
	- Created a Fitness App using JavaScript, React Native and Expo
	- The Fitness App merges the modern Fitness with the Ayurvedic Fitness Regimen of Ancient Indian Culture. It suggests Yogic Asanas and Ayurvedic Body Type depending on the weather and suggests diet changes according to the same. 
	- Made the entire Front End, UI and Design (including any Logos).
- [Anomaly Detection based Intrusion Detection System (IDS)](https://github.com/ArnavGautamGit/ML-IDS-WebApp-using-CSVs) ---> Sept 2023 to Nov 2023
	- Developed an Intrusion Detection System using Python to check for anomalous behaviour on the network using CSV files containing network packet info in them.
	- Implemented by training the model on real and anomalous data using logarithmic regression and other Machine Learning Model Training Methods.
	- Created a Basic HTML/CSS Website with 2 pages, one of which is used to upload CSV files to be scanned and the other is used to showcase anomalous vs normal data in the form of graphs.


## Leadership & Extra-Curricular
- Head of Public Relations @ Game Development Hub, JIIT ---> July 2023 to Aug 2024
	- Managed and Hosted major displays in the College Fests and Hackathons.
	- Held the first Workshop on the new Unreal Engine 5. It was such a hit that it became an annual workshop.
