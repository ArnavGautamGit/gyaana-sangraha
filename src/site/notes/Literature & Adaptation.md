# Literature & Adaptation
> Subject I studied during my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science Engineering from JIIT, Noida.

Do you need another reason to take this subject other than the two reasons that this is a LITERATURE subject and this is taught by the LEGENDARY Prof. Ekta Srivastava? The Very prof who taught [[Introduction to Literature\|Introduction to Literature]]?

### Syllabus
[[Forms of Adaptation\|Forms of Adaptation]]
[[Cinematic Language\|Cinematic Language]]
[[Audience Response Theories\|Audience Response Theories]]
[[Storytelling Structure\|Storytelling Structure]]

Similar to the previous subject, we had to use these concepts to assess characters and plots of various movies including [[The Godfather (1972)\|The Godfather (1972)]], [[Haider (Movie)\|Haider (Movie)]], [[To Sir, With Love (Movie)\|To Sir, With Love (Movie)]] but we ALSO had to compare these adaptations to other adaptations and even the original work.
