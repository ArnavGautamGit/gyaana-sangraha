# Wizard (DH)
> AÂ [[DH Character Creation#Character Class\|Character Class]] of strong spellcasters who using their Knowledge have acquired immensely powerful spells. Optimise the character by investing in [[Knowledge\|Knowledge]].

Unlike their [[Dungeons & Dragons\|D&D]] equivalent, where other spellcasters outside of the [[Wizard (D&D)\|Wizard (D&D)]] could use the same spells due to spell overlap, Wizards in [[Daggerheart\|Daggerheart]] are much more complete and do not suffer that nerf.

### Domains
Domains of a class decide the Domain Cards (and abilities) one gets to pick up.
Each Class has 2 fixed Domains.
The Wizard's domains are: [[Codex\|Codex]] and [[Splendor\|Splendor]].

### Base Scores
Base [[Evasion Score\|Evasion Score]]: 10
Major Damage Threshold: 5
Severe Damage Threshold: 10

### Class Items
Each Class has a specific item they choose which will be a plot point in the story. They
must choose one of the options.
For a Warrior, choose EITHER *"Book you're trying to translate"* OR *"Tiny & Harmless Pet"*

### Wizard's Hope - Special Ability
Spend 3x [[Hope Token\|Hope Token]] instead of marking your last [[Hit Point Slots\|HP Slot]].

### Class Feature
***Prestidigitation*** allows you to perform simple harmless magic at will. Like change an object's colour and give off a smell, light a candle etc..

***Strange Patterns*** allows the Wizard to choose a number between 1 to 12. Whenever you roll that number on either Duality Dice, gain a [[Hope Token\|Hope Token]] or clear a [[Stress Point\|Stress Point]]. This number will change at Long Rest.

### Class Foundations (Subclasses)
There are two subclasses for the Wizard - either School of War or School of Knowledge depending on Playstyle. Both use [[Knowledge\|Knowledge]] as Spellcasting Trait

- ***==School of Knowledge==*** are the studious Wizards who have great knowledge of Magic and the world around them.
	- ***Foundation Feature***
		- You've gained immense knowledge of the magical world around you.
		- **Adept**: Mark a [[Stress Point\|Stress Point]] to use an Experience instead of a [[Hope Token\|Hope Token]], when you use this Feature, the Experience Modifier is doubled.
	- ***Specialisation Feature***
		- You may change an experience then add +1 to each of them.
		- Once per short rest, when recalling a card from Vault to Loadout, you can reduce the cost by 1
	- ***Mastery Feature***
		- Choose 2 Experiences and add a +2 to each of them.
		- Whenever you need to use an Experience, roll a d6, on a result of 5 or 6 - you can use the Experience without spending a [[Hope Token\|Hope Token]].
- ***==School of War==*** is a subclass which uses magic for War almost exclusively.
	- ***Foundation Feature***
		- Gain an extra +1 to total number of [[Armour Slots\|Armour Slots]]
		- Add 1d10 magic damage if an attack roll succeeds with Fear.
	- ***Specialisation Feature***
		- As long as [[Hope Token\|Hope Token]] count is equal to or grater than 2, you can add Spellcast Trait to [[Evasion Score\|Evasion Score]].
