# Kingdom of Dragonpeaks
> A Kingdom surrounding the Dragonpeaks Mountain Ranges on the east and the south. 
> The Kingdom as seen in its current form was formed after [[The Wedding of Peace\|The Wedding of Peace]] and also [[The Raebershire Rebellion\|The Raebershire Rebellion]].

Kingdom of Dragonpeaks is one of the most powerful Kingdoms in the entirety of [[Lurov\|Lurov]] and might actually be the only that can give a tough fight to an all-colonising force such as the [[Miragerie\|Miragerie]]. Which is probably why it is reasonable to believe that Dragonpeaks might be the next target.

Current Monarch: [[Damian III Forechester\|Damian III Forechester]]
First Monarchs: [[Ivara II Bronze\|Ivara II Bronze]] & [[John VI Forechester\|John VI Forechester]]

### Noble Houses
The Kingdom is home to many noble houses & noble families which primarily consist of either Dragonborn/Drakona Royals who have been staying in the Kingdom and Ruling it for decades or the new human expats who came from [[Owlesia\|Owlesia]] after [[The Wedding of Peace\|The Wedding of Peace]].

The Draconic Noble Houses:

### Demography
Demography is dominated by humanoids and Draconic lineages where the most common ones are draconic bloodlines. A distribution of overall population is given below but it is important to note that if a particular ancestry or species is subdivisible then there are different spreads possible. 

In systems like [[Compendiums/D&D Compendium/Dungeons & Dragons\|D&D]], Dragonborn & Kobolds are both treated separately despite both being draconic but in Lurov, Kobolds are only found on mountain peaks in the most uninhabitable altitudes & are flavoured as a phenotype formed due to a mutation which causes them to have a smaller frame to aid in survival at high mountains.

| Ancestry | % of Total Populace  |
| -------- | -------------------- |
| Draconic | 43% (Kobolds are 5%) |
| Humans   | 35%                  |
| Giants   | 10%                  |
| Elves    | 5%                   |
| Simiah   | 3%                   |
| Ribbets  | 1%                   |
| Galapa   | 1%                   |
| Clanks   | 2%                   |
For all those ancestries that are not playable for players, they still exist in that world and NPCs of that ancestry do exist, The story, campaign or setting's people do not just vanish because the TTRPG system/game cannot accomodate them.
