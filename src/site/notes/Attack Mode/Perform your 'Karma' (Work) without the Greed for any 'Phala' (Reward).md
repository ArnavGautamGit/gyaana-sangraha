# Perform your 'Karma' (Work) without the Greed for any attached 'Phala' (Reward)
> An Indic Philosophy described in the [[Shrimad-Bhagavad Gītā\|Shrimad-Bhagavad Gītā]] which states that humans should distance themselves from working with an expectation of a reward. It is also an interesting study of how [[Thiestic Societies often have Philosophy intertwined with their Religious Character\|Thiestic Societies often have Philosophy intertwined with their Religious Character]] which is seen in Hinduism, Christianity and Greco-Roman Philosophy.

Krishna advised Arjuna against having expectations of a reward in exchange since many times the outcomes and rewards of our actions performed today do not come to complete perspective until much later which may discourage a person from working hard since there is an expectation of instantaneous reward attached to it if the expectation is not met.

These kinds of expectations may also cause the seeker to assume that all work must naturally come with some reward attached which is not true. The feeling of being discouraged is again seen in those whose similar assumptions get smashed to pieces. 

Moreover, when the person performs work with an expectation of reward in their mind, they tend to feel sad (or angry) when the reward feels disproportionately small to them or if the reward is denied altogether.

This is the reason that Krishna also says in the [[Shrimad-Bhagavad Gītā\|Shrimad-Bhagavad Gītā]] that "Expectation is the biggest cause for sorrow".

In [[Attack Mode/Attack Mode (Course)\|Attack Mode (Course)]], Shwetabh Gangwar argues that when the motivation for work is as selfish as a personal reward and happiness it tends to drive people towards pleasures, addictions and distractions (since they also release Dopamine and give us momentary happiness). 
He suggests to use an external source of motivation bigger than the individual seeking motivation. It could be the sense of nationalism in the individual, their faith in God or an attachment to creating/protecting their own Legacy which can drive them to strive to be better.
