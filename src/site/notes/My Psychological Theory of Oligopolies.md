# My Psychological Theory of Oligopolies
> My Personal Theory aimed at examining why most markets move to Oligopolies from a Psychological Perspective - which may be right or wrong.

I am no theologian or psychologist but I assume [[Decision Fatigue & Paradox of Choice\|Decision Fatigue & Paradox of Choice]] is why many markets swing towards Oligopolies. When there are many companies, a few outpower the others, due to their exceptional use of the other biases we studied in [[Books Library/The Art of Thinking Clearly\|The Art of Thinking Clearly]] & then the aspect of [[Social Proof\|Social Proof]] and [[Outcome Bias\|Outcome Bias]] carrying the "chosen" companies, even if the initial rise is not due to some better services offered, rather just due to [[Coincidence\|Coincidence]] or [[Liking Bias\|Liking Bias]] i.e., either someone randomly stumbled upon on of the "chosen" companies and word of mouth carried the initial wave of business or some people just liked something about one of the companies more than the competition either from the start or develop this bias later.

***Example***: Some people have a liking bias for Boat due to aesthetics and market price that they pitch their products at. Most people who have even elementary knowledge of music would know that the audio balance is horrible and calling it "Dominant" in Bass is an understatement since Bass is all that exists with Treble and Midrange like seasoning on Pizza.
