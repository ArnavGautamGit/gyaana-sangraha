# Digital Privacy in Cars
> Maintaining [[Personal Online Privacy\|Personal Online Privacy]] from the perspective of highly-connected modern cars that have their own SIM cards along with GPS location, Wi-Fi & Bluetooth receivers while being less secure due to having zero [[End-to-End Encryption\|End-to-End Encryption]].

Cars can record almost every conversation using microphones. 
Cars are collecting all your location data and driving behaviour (even providing you that data via the app which itself can be hacked easily). Imagine your cars location & camera data is routed through a server that lacks any encryption meaning this data is being watched and logged. This is also how Insurance Companies actually get info about your car because they know of each time you hit each button in your car (not hyperbole, [see here](https://youtu.be/eIryvRwxp9A?si=xOkmhw0x3EDt_F3f)).

### Event Data Recorders in Cars
Something similar to a [[Flight Data Recorder (FDR)\|Flight Data Recorder (FDR)]] in airplanes also called the "Black Box" is also present in cars by the name of Event Data Recorder (EDR). I monitors safe usage, airbag deployment, vehicle speed, engine speed, force of impact and a host of other metrics on top of those that you can see on the car's app. It is well known by car enthusiasts that the fastest way to access this is via the OBD port in your car. This port is often used to add better power delivery via [[Car Engine Tuning\|Car Engine Tuning]].

### How are Car Manufacturers using this data?
Car Manufacturers are probably selling this data to data brokers because how else are cars getting cheaper despite the vehicles being bigger, faster and getting more feature-rich? 

If you have a phone that has connected to a car with Android Auto then the phone is collecting data from your car (car data is not encrypted, remember?) and your car also collected data from phone including contact lists, messages, photos... some cars also make a full copy of your phone and transmit that data as plaintext!

According to [this article](https://www.techtimes.com/articles/296131/20230908/nissan-kia-cars-secretly-tracking-drivers-sex-lives-raises-privacy.htm) and thousands like this, Nissan and Kia Cars are even tracking your sexual lives through your car! All so they could send you targeted ads! Only 2% of all manufacturers even allow full data deletion in the first place! The same article also mentions how Tesla has the worst privacy of all cars (what could we expect from the CEO of an invasive  social media platform like X). Note how Nissan has cross-ownership in Renault while Kia is owned by Hyundai. There are heavy vulnerabilities in Acura/Honda & Toyota/Lexus cars too!

### How to Stop Manufacturers from using my data?
Go into your car's connected services app (or any name that the company uses for the app) and disable anything you can related to Data Sharing, Driver Scoring, Driving Analysis, Insurance Sharing and Smart Driver features and all that bullshit related to this stuff. 

### How to wipe all car data before selling?
Check if Privacy services like Privacy4Cars has a tutorial for your car to remove all your data using the infotainment system (also called head unit). Some even replace the head unit entirely before selling. 

Also please check with any LLMs like Grok and ChatGPT in case Privacy4Cars does not have a tutorial, these AIs scrape too much of the web to not know about some techniques that work like a charm.

### How to wipe previous owner's access to used car?
Connect to the app & make an account of yourselves. See which previous logins exist and logout any devices you do not know (which may be connected the previous owner) and do not forget basics we learnt in [[Personal Online Privacy\|Personal Online Privacy]] of using a strong password with 2FA.

If you are unable to connect the car to the app then it means the previous owner is still connected. Contact the used car dealership or the previous owner if you bought directly from the person.
