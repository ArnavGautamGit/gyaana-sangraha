# India's Foreign Policy
> India's [[Foreign Policy\|Foreign Policy]] note describes the [[Diplomacy\|Diplomatic]] Approach showcased by India over the course of the years since Independence in 1947.

First to understand the Indian Foreign Policy, we must understand the determinants of Indian Foreign Policy, we also talk about [[South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC)\|South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC)]] 
and why it is dysfunctional in its own note.

We also talk about India's [[Look East Policy\|Look East Policy]] and [[Act East Policy\|Act East Policy]] in detail in their own notes for the sake of keeping this note smaller.

### Determinants
1. ***Colonial Legacy*** - Influenced by its Colonial past, India started taking an anti-Imperialist stand & propagated the [[Non-Alligned Movement (NAM)\|Non-Alligned Movement (NAM)]].
2. ***[[Non-Alligned Movement (NAM)\|Non-Alligned Movement (NAM)]]*** - as mentioned before, during the Cold War staying non-alligned helped us marginally except showing our commitment to the World until 1971 when we went into the Soviet Camp quite formally.
3. ***Border Disputes*** with Pakistan & China
4. ***[[Panchsheel of 1954\|Panchsheel of 1954]]*** - Five values which no one cared about.
5. ***Security Concerns for neighbours*** in 1947 Pakistan's attack on Kashmir ([[1st India-Pakistan War (1947)\|1st India-Pakistan War (1947)]]) & 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War ([[3rd India-Pakistan War (1971)\|3rd India-Pakistan War (1971)]]).
6. ***Strategic Autonomy*** - especially today when we are alligned with all.
7. ***Nuclear Policy*** - Not First Use of Nuclear Arms after [[India's 1st Nuclear Tests (1974)\|India's 1st Nuclear Tests (1974)]] and [[India's 2nd Nuclear Tests (1998)\|India's 2nd Nuclear Tests (1998)]], refusal to sign [[Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT)\|Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT)]].
8. ***India's [[Soft Power\|Soft Power]] Diplomacy***
9. ***[[Indian Diaspora\|Indian Diaspora's]] leverage*** -[[Diaspora Diplomacy\|Diaspora Diplomacy]].
