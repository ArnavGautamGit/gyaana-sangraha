# History of the Nāgavanshīs
The word Nair originates from the word Nāgar (Meaning Nāga/People of the serpent clan). The modern Nair community is very diverse and fragmented because it was formed out of multiple migrations.

Earliest mention of the exact word ‘Nair’ also appears on the walls of a 9th century stone fortress called Bhoodathan Kotta at Trikodithanam (on the outskirts of Changanaserry). There are references to ‘Pada Nairs’ (warriors) in two stone carvings dating to the early Chera era (AD 900) at the Shiva temple of Nedumpuram Thali in Talapalli taluk of Thrissur. But if we check deviations of this word Nair, then there has been more ancient mentions. 

The Nairs have been known as a martial community since antiquity. The Roman philosopher Pliny the Elder in 77AD called them "Nareae, the swordsmen, the military caste". He also write about the Geography of the people in hos writings, he obviously uses Greek denominattions and nomenclature of locations: "The Nareae are shut in by the Capitalis range, the highest of all the mountains of India".
Capitalis is identified as Aravalli range by many historians. So here we can see that this was the period when Nairs lived towards the South of Aravallis and hadn't reached the southwest coast.

(Some sources say that Nairs descent from Mewari Rajputs who migrated from Rajasthan due to internal disputes. Another migrant assimilation into Nairs is from Purannat Swaroopam. Many people with the Nagar surname are found in Northern India. Since the root word Nagar become Nair, it means that both the surnames refer to the same people)

Then fast-forward some centuries, we can see that in Late Sangam Vattezhuttu inscriptions , we can see the mention of the word 'Nākar' used to refer to snake worshipping warriors. Now, in Manimekali(which is composed around 6th century AD) also, we can see the word 'Nākar'. In one of the inscription they are mentioned as speaking a language different from Tamils but a learnable one. From this we can guess that Nairs might have started appearing in Outer regions of Tamizhagam and interacting with the native Tamilians during this time period. This was probably the first wave of Nairs.

Now, it's also possible that another wave of Nairs came later. This statement is based on information from both medivial Tulu Grama Paddhati and the 17th century Keralolpathi(which is derived from Keralapmahatmyam, an Upapuranam). King Mayurasharma of Kadamba kingdom brought Brahmins from Ahikshetra for the purpose of rejuvenate the ancient Vedic faith and to perform the royal rituals and the related functions of the government. These Brahmins appointed/hired Nāga warriors to accompany them for protection throughout their journey. These Nāga warriors got settled in an area in Karnataka, which came to be known as Nāgarkhanda/ Nāyarkhanda. Overtime they had spread to some other parts of Karnataka. They had also given rise to small kingdoms like the Sendrakas.
Now, in Keralolpathi, a report of an invasion from Tulunad(Southern Karnataka) was mentioned. It was mentioned that a certain Banaperumal under Rashtrakuta king Krishna III invaded Chera kingdom with 350000 Nairs and brought Cheras under Rashtrakuta dominance. This also seems plausible considering that in recorded history, at one point Chera Perumals indeed paid tribute to Rashtrakutas. So this is the second wave of Nairs.

These 2 waves make up the base of the Nair population today.

Nairs started gaining prominence in Kerala slowly slowly during the era of Chera-Perumals. They recieved land grants for military service and started becoming Utaiyavars/cheiftains. This was obviously the period when Nair military prowess showed itself in all its glory and gave birth to legends during the reign of Chera Emperor Rama Varma Kulashekhara (1020-1102), the most famous of the Cheraman Perumals. It was a time when wars with the Imperial Cholas raged across Malabar and the Nair armies formed suicide squads to do battle for the Cheras. The defence of the kingdom was entrusted to a group of Nair warriors called Patinayiram (10,000) with a Patamel Nair as its chieftain. From the Chera bastion of Kodungalloor (then known as Mahodayapuram), elite squads called Chaver-pada (meaning, one who has elected to die fighting), spread terror among the invading Chola forces. The Nairs dominated the social, political, cultural, and ethical levels of society creating the ‘Zeitgeist’ or the spirit of the times.

But the Chera-Chola wars lasted more than a hundred years, bringing about major societal upheavals and creating many Nair traditions like the anthropologically interesting matrilineal way of inheritance (marumakkatayam) and the 'sambandham’ marriage system. Before these wars only a portion of Nairs were matrilinear and that too because those ones claimed to be descendants of Nāgadevi Manasa/ Nāgayakshi.

Now as Nairs turned more and more fierce, their fame among travellers grew.

"In this region of Malabar," wrote European traveller Gaspar Correa, writing on the three voyages of Vasco da Gama, "the race of Gentlemen is called Nairs who are people of war. They are people who are very refined in blood and customs and separated from all other people.. The Nayros must \[in all places\] where they go or stand wear such arms as are appointed for them and always be ready at the King's commandement.
“As these Nayros go about in the streets they shout po! po!”. Gaspar describes how three Nair nobleman from the Zamorin’s court came aboard Gama’s ship. They had gold ear-rings, gold bracelets above the elbow, they were bare-chested and carried a sword and shield 

In Nair families, young boys began military training at the age of seven in the several kalaris that dotted the land. Italian Jesuit Giovanni Maffei talked about the Nairs in his Historiarum in 1588: "Young Nairs ....they are expert wrestlers but still more proficient in the use of weapons...At one time, their weapons were the spear, arrows, the sword and the shield....now they emply all cannons and fireams with consummate skill; ...with only their private parts covered, do they go into battle, wearing neither breastplates nor helmets.

Maffei also gives a glimps of the Nair's inclination for guerilla warfare."Their greatest protection is flight...but they flee and reappear in a flash and they hurl their javelins ...and if there is hand to hand combat they do most of the killing."

The Nair always showed a fascination for weapons. Dutch Rear-Admiral John Splinter Stavorinus wrote about this aspect in 1798: “Amongst the Malabars, the Nairs are the nobles and warriors of the land; they are known by the scimitar which they always wear whenever they stir abroad, and in the management of which, I was told they are very dexterous, particularly against a flying enemy. They have many privileges above the common people.”

Dr. Claudius Buchanan, a Scottish theologian, in his Christian Researchers in Asia (1811) said: “Their childlike delight is in parading up and down fully armed. Each man has a firelock, and at least one sword; but all those who wish to be thought men of extraordianry courage carry two sabres and they are more inclined to use them for assassination or surprise, than in the open field.”

International explorer and writer Richard Burton (who translated the Arabian Nights and the Kamasutra) wrote about the Nairs in the 1850s. “The Nairs are rather a fair and comely race, with neat features, clean limbs, and decidedly a high caste look. They shave the head all over, excepting one long thin lock of hair, which is knotted at the end, and allowed to lie flat upon the crown....Their arms were sword and shield, spear and matchlock, with a long knife or dagger suspended behind the back by a hook attached to a leathern waistband. Being now deprived of their favourite pastimes —fighting and plundering — they have become cultivators of the soil, and disdain not to bend over the plough, an occupation formerly confined to their slaves. And yet to the present day they retain much of their old military character, and with it the licentiousness which in Eastern countries belongs to the profession of arms. In fact," war, wine, and women " appear to be the three ingredients of their summum honum, and forced abstinence from the first, only increases the ardour of their afiection for the last two.” An interesting observation, indeed!

This last observation by Richard Burton showed the degeneration of Nair community under the British influence.
After the passage of many generations, they became increasingly attached to the land as agricultural landlords and the Malabar Manual of 1901 notes that “the Nayar is more and more becoming a family man. Comparatively few of them nowadays even engage in hunting” and Captain Heber Drury reported even earlier (in 1858): “ The mild and delicate looking Nayar now prefers a quite swing in the verandah or a lounge under a tree, chewing a betel.” The warrior Nair had at last returned home!

After the Kerala Rennaisance and the so called reformations, many aspects of Nair culture have become unrecognisable and unintelligible. Some customs and rituals may even have got lost in the mist of time, due to lack of survivable documentation. Nowadays, although many individual Nairs permeate and transcend through most honorable fields, as a community they are just a shadow of their former(medivial) selves.
 

Nagavanshi Nairs are descendants of Nāgas(who were a warrior Kshatriya clan).

They have been called as Nākas/Nākars in Sangam literature. Now indigenous Nairs were the Nākas/Nākars present in Sangam Literature and were descendants of Ananta as per legends. Here is a song from a Sangam age Vattezhuttu inscription.
