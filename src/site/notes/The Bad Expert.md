# The Bad Expert
Since Forecasters never face reputation damage or financial penalties for getting things wrong, they are incentivised to keep coming up with new forecasts regardless of their accuracies. Sometimes Experts can perform worse due to [[Overconfidence Effect\|Overconfidence Effect]].

The Good ones would still fear for their reputation and avoid such steps. If the expert is an employee, they could lose their job if they are always wrong or giving wrong inciteful opinions.

The Bad Expert is a self-emplyed Guru who always earns through selling courses, books and the like - experts like this rely on media attention and hence their predictions and forecasts will be sensational and more often then not, they will be wrong due to [[Overconfidence Effect\|Overconfidence Effect]].

Experts should be judged by their success rate - the same way we judge technology like effectiveness of [[Cache Memory\|Cache Memory]]

In short,
> "Do not believe in any expert who can just predict and does not face any repurcussions for it since they are self employed and rely on selling courses and books to make a living instead of actually researching or working in the field they hold "expertise" in (except those who do not make predictions at all)."
