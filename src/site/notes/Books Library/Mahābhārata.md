# Mahābhārata
> The Longest Scripture of Religious importance if I have ever heard of one. It follows the Story of [[Lord Krishna\|Lord Krishna]] in the [[Dwapar Yuga\|Dwapar Yuga]] and the War of Kurukshetra.

It is the part of the [[Itihāsa\|Itihāsa]] branch of Texts in Hindu Scriptures & hence considered a part of Hindu History.

The Religious Scripture of [[Books Library/Shrimad-Bhagavad Gītā\|Shrimad-Bhagavad Gītā]] is considered a summary of this text since it is a small part of the totality of Mahābhārata. It may not get all the details right compared to the full 6 volumes of Mahābhārata (as printed by Gītapress Gorakhpur)
