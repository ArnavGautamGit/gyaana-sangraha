# Planning Phase of Productivity
> A phase of productivity as explained in [[Independent Courses/Attack Mode/Attack Mode (Course)\|Attack Mode (Course)]].

The Technique is simple. Repeatable Tasks that repeat for a certain frequency and you don't work on intensity or energy levels.

### Abandon "Intensity-based Work"
If you are working on something using Attack Mode for the first time, there is a very good chance that you may find it "fun". If your schedule says that the task is supposed to be done for 1 hour then at the ring of the bell, you get up.

If this thought of "I am finding this fun, let's do a bit more" leaks into your [[Independent Courses/Attack Mode/Neuroplasticity\|Neuroplasticity]], it is basically a signal to the times when you will skip a task because you are "not in the mood" or the task "does not feel like fun to do anymore".

### Consensus on Repeat Frequency
Repeat Frequency is the frequency with which a task repeats. It could be daily, bi-weekly, weekly, monthly etc.
You need to choose the frequency based on Urgency. Less Urgent? Once a Week. More Urgent? Daily.

Urgency and Deadlines decide the frequency and time duration of work.
