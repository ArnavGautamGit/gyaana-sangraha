# Intercepting Email Headers
> The Act of Intercepting the emails sent from one email address to the other. As emails are encrypted - the headers are the only thing that we can truly intercept.

The Email Header provides us with the following information:
1. Sender's email adress, full name and IP address
2. Receiver's email
3. Encryption Algorithm used byt the mail server
4. Unique number given to sender's mail server
5. Date and Time of the email being originally sent.

Emails can also be tracked using the Email treackers like:
1. EmailTrackerPro
2. Email Lookup
3. YesWare
4. WhoReadMe
5. DidTheyReadIt
6. Trace Email
