# Reverse Proxy Server
> [[Proxy Servers\|Proxy Servers]] that do not reveal themselves as proxies at all. They communicate with the original server and forward their reply to the user as if proxy are the original server. They are placed ahead of the originals and may be communicating with more than 1 original server.

They are the primary and best way of protecting against [[DOS Attack\|DOS Attack]] and [[DDOS Attack\|DDOS Attack]] given that there exists a filter between the proxies and the originals.
They are also known as "surrogates" and are meant as sacrificial servers to protect the originals from attacks.
