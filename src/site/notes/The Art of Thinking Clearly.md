# What is the book about?
> A book that teaches the reader a path of taking clear decisions based solely on the factual reality & free from any biases whether inherent or artificially planted in our brain. 

The book was originally written in German and translated to English by Nicky Griffin. I am reading the English Variant. It is an important book for taking clear decisions in life - especially in our Youth - since choices that are made here shape the direction of our lives - clarity of decisions would mean we are actually working towards a goal and making progress instead of being left course-correcting our entire Youth.

### General Lessons Learnt from the Book
[[The Bad Expert\|The Bad Expert]] - Do not believe in any expert who can just predict and does not face any repurcussions for it since they are self employed and rely on selling courses and books to make a living instead of actually researching or working in the field they hold "expertise" in.

[[Smart People are Shy\|Smart People are Shy]] - They already have realised that they don't know much compared how much there is to know.

[[Mental Anchors\|Mental Anchors]] - the boon & curse of God.

[[Exponential Growth\|Exponential Growth]] - something people need to wrap their heads around.
