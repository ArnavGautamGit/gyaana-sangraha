# Marshalling of Arms
> Tradition followed in [[Heraldry\|Heraldry]] where more than one [[Heraldic Achievement\|Arms]] are showed on the same shield - often signifying marriage or taking up a new office among others dependent upon the various [[Heraldic Traditions\|Heraldic Traditions]].

Marshalling can occur as [[Quartered Arms\|Quartered Arms]], [[Impaled Arms\|Impaled Arms]], [[Composed Arms\|Composed Arms]] or [[Inescutcheon\|Inescutcheon]].
Marshalling is most popular as Impaled or Quartered form which are used after marriage to create new arms to be used by descendents of the married couple. Sometimes Inescutcheons are used over arms that feature Quartering.

When Marshalled Arms are used as new arms for the next generation of armigers, each individual armorial achievement is treated as one [[Divisions of the Shield\|Division of the Shield]].
