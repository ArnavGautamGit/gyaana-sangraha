# South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC)
> [[Regional Economic Frameworks in Geopolitics\|Regional Socio-Economic Framework]] of South Asian [[State (United Nations)\|Member States]] including India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Bhutan. Later joined by Maldives and Afghanistan.

Formed on 8th December 1985, in Dhaka with headquarters in Kathmandu.
Total 8 Members and 9 Observer States.
Afghanistan was the latest joinee in 2007.

### Special Infrastructure
[[South Asian University (SAU)\|South Asian University (SAU)]] & all its campuses got closed after a Pakistani Student got thrashed black & blue in the campus in New Delhi. 
[[South Asian Regional Standards Organisation (SARSO)\|South Asian Regional Standards Organisation (SARSO)]] was opened in Dhaka
[[SAARC Development Fund\|SAARC Development Fund]] was headquartered in Bhutan.
[[SAARC Arbitration Council (SARCO)\|SAARC Arbitration Council (SARCO)]] was headquartered in Pakistan (which is what Pakistan leveraged with one-sided judgements).

### Dysfunctional
Last Summit was supposed to be held in November 2016 but was cancelled due to Uri Terrorist Attack in Kashmir done by Pakistan-sponsered [[Terrorism\|Terrorist Groups]].

SAARC was replaced by [[Bay of Bengal Iniative for Multi-Sectoral Technical & Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC)\|Bay of Bengal Iniative for Multi-Sectoral Technical & Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC)]] which was basically SAARC without Pakistan. Later Bangladesh slowly started singing the Pakistani tune (due to being Muslim majority) and BIMSTEC also went dysfunctional.

SAARC effectively broke down because it was Pakistan's Terrorist agenda that had divided the Association into 2 groups: Pro-Pakistan & Anti-Pakistan. Afghanistan was the only muslim [[State (United Nations)\|Member State]] that was against Pakistan (they have their own reasons) as seen in : [[South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC)#^1\|1]])

The Anti-Pakistan Countries were done with having a Terrorist State in the Association, many who were explicitly not on Pakistan's side internally supported India - like Nepal did & still supports India in cases of Terror Attacks.

### Original Objectives
1. Promote Welfare of the South Asian People & improve their quality of life.
2. Accelerate Economic Growth, Social Progress and "Cultural Development" (idk what's that)
3. Promote and Strengthen Collective Self-Reliance of South Asian Countries.
4. Contribute to mutual trust & understanding of each other's beliefs.
5. Synergy of common culture, dressing and backgrounds to drive collective economic growth.

### Significance & Importance
SAARC (if it was functional) could have used it to connect itself with ASEAN. Even go to the extent of being able to form an [[Asian Union\|Asian Union]].

SAARC could have seen greater cooperation with ASEAN to build a counter to China if only Pakistan had not become China's pet. If only Pakistan would let go of the bitter rivalry and sponsorship of [[Terrorism\|Terrorism]], SAARC could have been way ahead.

Why should SAARC stop meeting in Nepal like they used to if Pakistan is being problematic? Call all other members except Pakistan to the summit. The summit as a whole must go on.

### Achievements
Many Agreements like [[SAARC Preferential Trade Agreement (SAPTA)\|SAARC Preferential Trade Agreement (SAPTA)]] of 1995 which evolved into the [[SAARC Free Trade Agreement (SAFTA)\|SAARC Free Trade Agreement (SAFTA)]] which reduced taxes to zero on goods (not services). 
[[South Asian University (SAU)\|South Asian University (SAU)]] also called "SAARC University" helped in Cultural Exchange among people.

### Challenges
SAARC is dysfunctional primarily due to India-Pakistan tensions created by Pakistan. It also has low number of annual meetings.
