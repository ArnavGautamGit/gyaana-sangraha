# Introduction to Literature
> Subject I studied during my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science Engineering from JIIT, Noida.

Taught by Professor Ekta Srivastava, this subject quickly became my favourite in the entire curriculum - surprising this is the subject which is most unlike my degree! Along with other subjects I thoroughly enjoyed! Prof. Ekta is the best professor along with others in the HSS department that JIIT has to offer.

### Syllabus
[[Psycho-Analysis in Literature\|Psycho-Analysis in Literature]]
[[Critical Theories of Literature\|Critical Theories of Literature]]
[[Storytelling Structure\|Storytelling Structure]]
Apart from this, there were many works of Literature introduced
We had to apply these concepts in assessing characters & story of said works.
Pygmalion by [[George Bernard Shaw\|George Bernard Shaw]] was one of such included works.
