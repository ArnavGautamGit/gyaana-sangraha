# Ethical Hacking & Prevention
> Subject in 7th Semester of my B.Tech Computer Science Degree which teaches us what [[Ethical Hacking\|Ethical Hacking]] is, why it is needed and how to perform it if we land a job where we need to do this for a living.

Subject is taught by Professor Shariq Murtuza. He teaches very well with live demos although he does not seem enthusiastic about teaching anymore and often tells us to read the slides but he answers questions with a lot of thought & shares knowledge when you ask or he sometimes makes us do the questions based on the slides while he roams the class checking emails. 
He is often also seen in his room/cabin watching various Web Series Episodes.
