# Diaspora
> Diaspora is defined as an [[Ethnicity\|ethnic group]] dispersed among many [[State (United Nations)\|States]] outside their home state. Diasporas may be defined by Nationality, Religion or any other common metric. 

It is widely noted that the Diaspora is often vocal about historical injustices and the community's cause & tend to put internal pressure on the ruling party or government of the new land regarding these issues that plague their homeland of origin. 

### Double-Edged Sword
If leveraged well, it can work wonders like the [[Indian Diaspora\|Indian-Americans]] being successful in affecting [[Donald J. Trump#First Presidential Term (2016-2020)\|Trump's Policies in the First Term]] to be more pro-India and pro-Indians despite him saying multiple times that he will deport Indians & reserve all prestigious IT jobs for Americans. Immediately Indian Government sensed this and Modi & Trump soon became friends after Trump had to do the [[Howdy Modi Event\|Howdy Modi Event]] to please the Indian-Americans.

If not leveraged at all or leveraged poorly i.e., the government disconnects with their diaspora spread across the world, then it spells bad news for that government similar to the disagreement between the Government of Armenia & Armenian-Americans regarding the recognition of the Armenian Genocide being conducted by Turkey.

### Diaspora Overlap
Diasporas may also overlap depending upon Context. Since States are collection of multiple ethnicities, cultures and religions & divided among different social/economic classes (Rich, Poor, Middle Class etc.)

Indian Diaspora contains the Hindu Diaspora among other religious Identities but since Hindus are also in majority in Nepal, Hindus seldom leave their national diasporas aside and work together. Similarly certain Sikhs, Jains, Muslims and Christians from India also leve their religious & [[Ethnicity\|ethnic identities]] to stand with their Home [[State (United Nations)\|State]] of origin.

***Example***: The Nepalese People supported India when the Pehalgam Terrorist Attack took place in Kashmir 2025 since Hindus had been segregated from Muslims before being shot point blank. One of the Hindus shot was a Nepalese Citizen.

### Cultural Ambassadors
Hindus increase the [[Soft Power\|Soft Power]] of Hindus by exporting Hindu Culture around the world & hence increasing the Soft Power of India & Nepal.
Diaspora are Cultural Brand Ambassadors & link across their Homeland & multiple States where the diaspora lives.
