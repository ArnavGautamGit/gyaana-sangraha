# Campaign One - Daggerheart One Shot
This is a prologue campaign to the main Homebrew [[Campaign One - House of Forechester\|Campaign One - House of Forechester]]. While the main campaign is supposed to be played with Friends & Players I find, this one is supposed to be played in our College Fest as a way to find players and test my skill as a GM because this will be the first time I will be playing face-to-face [[Daggerheart\|Daggerheart]] and also be the first time ever that I will be the GM.

The Story starts in our Homebrew World.

The two main Human Royal Families - [[The Bronze-Forchester-Raebershire Family Tree.canvas\|Forechester and Raebershire Families]] who ruled the [[Kingdom of Dragonpeak\|Kingdom of Dragonpeak]] along with [[Drakona (DH)\|Drakona (DH)]] of the region, had a problem. Since Forechester was the Ruling House, [[House Raebershire\|House Raebershire]] often felt neglected, things got so bad that they indirectly demanded their own separate Kingdom & [[House Forechester\|House Forechester]] was internally very happy thinking it is only for their better - no longer will this internal politics and bickering affect their foreign policy with their land neighbours ([[United Orken Front\|United Orken Front]]) or their maritime neighbours ([[The Elven Confederacy\|The Elven Confederacy]]).

The Raebershires did not explicitly say they wanted a separate kingdom since a) that demand would never be accepted by the Forechesters who are the ones in power and b) there were some who still believed that both the houses were stronger together.
So the Raebershires just said that there was "a need to have an expansionist mindset" if the [[Kingdom of Dragonpeak\|Kingdom of Dragonpeak]] was to ever get prosperous. Forechesters were ardently against it and so was the Drakona Population.

It was finalised after some internal politics that the Forces under House Raebershire would attack the Northern Lands of the [[Clan Wishborne\|Clan Wishborne]] (which later became part of [[The Elven Confederacy\|The Elven Confederacy]]) so that the Raebershire can get their own land, there are less nations around that can potentionally get hostile towards them and they can surround [[United Orken Front\|United Orken Front]] from two sides.

House Forechester was in a win-win situation - they do not need to worry about what happens to the Raebershires, since even if the house were to lose, they could deny involvement and kick the house out of their kingdom.

The War could not come to the desired objective for anyside. 

In [[Kingdom of Dragonpeak\|Kingdom of Dragonpeak]], The younger nobles within the Forechesters who had no real connection to the internal politics but were loved and adored by the crowd (since they frequented the streets more than the elder nobles) were apprehensive about why there was no help being provided to the Raebershires - there was rumour in the Halls of the Forechester Castle that the people may organise an uprising if Forechesters do not help Raebershires since the people would think that the [[The Elven Confederacy\|The Elven Confederacy]] may attack [[Kingdom of Dragonpeak\|Kingdom of Dragonpeak]] after dealing with House Beta.

On the battlefield, after facing heavy casualties on both ends yet Raebershires only able to  capture 10% and some change of the Elven Lands with no major victory except taking over the Original Wishborne Castle, the humans looked weak. Elven Spies had just received Intel on a new threat - construction of a new walled city of Riverfoot near Lake Oasis further south near the southern peaks - Elves felt they might get flanked from the side by the Orcs too. Peacetalks are initiated between the two. Raebershires claim to have support from Dragonpeak - which if true is the equivalent to sounding of a massive horn which proclaims the death of all elves. During the peacetalks after the first meeting many Elven Lords were contemplating joining the Raebershires - one such family which actually took the step were the Darpleys controlling a Stronghold in the western edges in the kingdom - often neglected in all council meetings due to "more pressing matters" being at hand... the Darpleys felt that not only would they get their revenge on the High Council but also would be doing a great SERVICE to the Elven Race as a whole - by keeping it alive.

Forechesters have a new problem, a trade shipment to the Orken Town of [[Vranik\|Vranik]] was looted dry and shipped back - being driven by a Orken Sailor Pirate declared traitor to Zlanta and sent as a scapegoat to make sure the heavily damaged, empty ship filled only by the corpses of humans and Drakonas is sent back to its original source - the Port City of Eslance. Even if that scapegoat Orc is killed, it would generate nothing. The scapegoat would not even know any information they can share for some value.

Citing these problems, the Forechesters deny any involvement with Raebershires in their letter to the Elven Kingdom, when the Elves raised this point in the next meeting, the Raebershires wished to confirm this themselves and got the reply that an attack from the Orcs may threaten Dragonpeak if they decide to send aid. It was finally the third meeting where the matter was sorted and this new alliance was decided.

Raebershires and Elves form a union fearing if they do not, the other party among the two would try to decimate the third by creating an alliance with [[Kingdom of Ironmouth\|Kingdom of Ironmouth]].

This is where the Party comes in: a band of adventures hired to investigate - not sending their soldiers means there is no patches, faces or anything else that is recognisable. Orken lands have their share of Humans and Half-Orcs - so the [[Human\|Human]] party would blend right in! It is important to know that while the characters know each other, but for the benefit of the players, please give us a brief overview about your characters.
