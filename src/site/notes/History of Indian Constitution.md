# History of Indian Constitution

1. The Work on Indian Constitution started in 13th December, 1946 (at the presentation of "Objective Resolution") by Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru and was adopted on 22nd January, 1947. However, it should also be noted that the idea of a Constituent Assembly for India for the first time was put forward by **M.N. Roy** - who was a pioneer of the communist movement in India in 1934.
2. Dr. Sachchidananda Sinha was the first president (temporary) of the Constituent Assembly when it met on December 9, 1946.
3. Later, Dr. Rajendra Prasad became the President of the Constituent Assembly and Dr. Bhimrao Ambedkar became the Chairman of its drafting committee on December 11,1946.
4. Dr. BN Rau became the Constitutional Advisor of the Constituent Assembly around the same time. He is often described as the Architect of the Indian Constitution (He also helped Burma build their Constitution)
5. Dr B. R. Ambedkar in his concluding speech in constituent assembly on 25 November 1949 stated that:  
   >"The credit that is given to me does not really belong to me. It belongs partly to Sir B.N.
   >The draft of his consisted of 243 articles and 13 schedules which came to 395 articles and 8 schedules after discussions, debates and amendments."
