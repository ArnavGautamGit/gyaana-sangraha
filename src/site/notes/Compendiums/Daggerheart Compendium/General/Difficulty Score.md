# Difficulty Score
> The minimum score one needs to meet or beat on the dice to deal damage to an adversary or perform any action which is deemed to require a roll by the [[Game Master (GM)\|GM]].

With reference to Adversaries however, the Difficulty Score acts as a villain-analogous to the [[Compendiums/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Evasion Score\|Evasion Score]] of Player Characters (PCs). All rolls of the PCs must meet or beat the Difficulty Score of the Adversary to land the hit.
