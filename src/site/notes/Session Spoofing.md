# Session Spoofing
> A Special kind of Masquerading Attack or [[Identity Theft\|Identity Theft]] where the attacker pretends to be the system, the user or server to commit the crime and escape [[Non-Repudiation\|Non-Repudiation]].

Session Spoofing generally is used to bypass the final phase in the [[Phases of Hacking\|Phases of Hacking]] by essentially pinning the blame on the person whose account/likeness/system was spoofed while the attacker gets the extra time to prepare and run.
