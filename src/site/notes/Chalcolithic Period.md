# Chalcolithic Period
> Period in Human History where Copper as a metal was discovered by Humans and they started using Copper and Stone utensils together while some objects may have both stones and Copper together.

Chalcolithic Phase lasted from 4000 BC to 700 BC. 
This is the period where farming has become mainstream enough that Copper being introduced into society has brought enough wealth that people believe that trade & commerce is the future to make a massive amount of money. So while the big chunk of the family is probably still involved in farming, some of the kids are working in trade - either as coppersmith, or as a seller - something along those lines.

People began to move where lands were more fertile - so that fewer people could generate similar produce, land was plenty and a coast for a way to export goods was even better! 

Due to this, at around 3000 BC there is a wave of urbanisation along the entire world and civilisations form around lands which are extremely fertile and near a source of water big enough to sustain a civilisation. [[Ancient Egyptian Civilisation\|Ancient Egyptian Civilisation]] came up next to the Nile River while in India, near the Indus, its 5 tributaries along with the Saraswati River and some of its tributaries that must have existed - this (in present-day Western India and Pakistan) was the perfect space to lay foundations of the [[Indus Valley Civilsation\|Indus Valley Civilsation]].

This wave of urbanisation had begun everywhere at around 3000 BC.
Beyond this point, histories of people diverge to different areas and singular homogenous history is not possible since humans have progressed beyond the point of being simple creatures in a society of a few hundred at a time - cities in different locations developed different cultures.

### Excavation Sites in India
In India, good excavation sites for the period before the [[Indus Valley Civilsation\|Indus Valley Civilsation]] are: ***Ganeshwara*** and ***Jodhpur*** are regions where the oldest dated Copper implements were found. Apart from these there are sites like ***Rangpura***, ***Saifai***, ***Dimabad***, ***Eran***, ***Chirand***, ***Marki***, ***Hallur***, ***Pandu Raja Dhibi*** and ***Brahmagiri***.
