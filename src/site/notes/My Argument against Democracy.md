# My Argument against Democracy
> I use my knowledge of Philosophy and Politics to form and present m case against [[Democracy\|Democracy]] as a "better" system of governance.

Each argument is under its own subheading, the arguments are also listed here:
[[My Argument against Democracy#Dilemma of Differing Perspectives\|Dilemma of Differing Perspectives]]


### Dilemma of Differing Perspectives
People often refer to Corruption when talking of arguments against Democracy and it is not even the least of the foremost & foundational problems in this political system.

In the pre-democratic era, common people only had to worry about their work, food and kids. Possibly their child's education joined the list if they could afford it. Politics was left to the Kings, Queens & the Lords ruling over them.

> जिसका काम उसी को साजे।
> और करे तो डंडा बाजे॥
> ~ Translation: "the work suits the one whose hands are supposed/skilled to do it, other hopefulls get beaten up with sticks \[since they anger others by messing up the work\]"

In [[Democracy\|Democracy]], since everyone has a vote and it is common sense not to waste a resource at one's disposal, politics is now shoved down the throat of every single citizen on planet earth who lives under a democratic government.

The voter is thinking on a micro perspective because that's all they know and they have no information on what is happening on a macro scale at any time apart from what the government chooses to share. Each second used to understand the macro happenings detracts from their personal life.

When the government thinks it thinks on a macro scale but when the voter judges, they judge the government's performance on a micro scale, the difference in perspectives means that the people will be dissatisfied today or many years later but the disconnect among people & the rulers will forever stay and there will always be people who will be dissatisfied - just like how people were dissatisfied with the governments before. So what has democracy changed? Made the lives of the people busier and make the people fight amongst themselves because they are desperately trying to find an identity from themselves trying to balance the micro and macro state of mind.

Democracy makes them see themselves as a herd of sheep who can elect a lion but the fact is that to contest the election, the candidate has to be a sheep either due to relatability or by law which leads even the perfectly capable candidate has to behave as [[A Lion in Sheep's Clothing\|A Lion in Sheep's Clothing]] and protect this secret forever, else the candidate will lose.

The fact is that Humanity as a whole is a bunch of perenially dissatisfied creatures running towards their collective doom and no system of governance can help them.

Democracy is just as bad as the other similarly vilified systems of governance like [[Monarchy\|Monarchy]], [[Constitutional Monarchy\|Constitutional Monarchy]] and [[Dictatorship\|Dictatorship]]. In fact, I would argue that Democracy is worse since it gives the delusion to the people to think they have the power to decide who is the capable leader whereas what you are really deciding is who is the better marketer who can market themselves better than the rest.
