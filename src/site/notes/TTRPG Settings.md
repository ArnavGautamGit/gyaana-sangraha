# TTRPG Settings
> A Collection of Campaign Settings I have read about, played on (or both).

This links to an Obsidian Bases file which I do not know if it can be visible at all for website viewers or not. Setting Tempates do not specify campaigns because the same setting can be played on any [[Table-Top Role-Playing Game\|TTRPG]].

Some May be both [[TTRPG Settings\|settings]] and [[TTRPG Campaigns\|campaigns]], like the [[Compendiums/Daggerheart Compendium/Homebrew/Flaming Lotus/Flaming Lotus\|Flaming Lotus]] which is set in fantasy South & South East Asia where all major powers are at their peak at the same time & has its own homebrew shit. So the setting is not a fixed "13th century Europe" thing but custom made and finely curated selection of nations & kingdoms reflective of the diversity of the regions.
