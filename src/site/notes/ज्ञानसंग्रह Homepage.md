# Welcome to ज्ञानसंग्रह !!

ज्ञानसंग्रह is a Sanskrit name formed by the concatenation of two Sanskrit Words: 
1. ज्ञान (Knowledge or Wisdom) 
2. संग्रह (Repository)

Putting them together you can easily understand that this is a Knowledge Repository which I use for learning in public and simultaneously backing up my notes via GitHub.

Since this is a repositiory similar to Wikipedia, you are free to press Ctrl+K (or Command+K for Mac Users) to open the Search bar & search for a specific item or note or scroll down and click a bright link (dim ones are not uploaded due to being incomplete).

If you are here to hire me? Please look at [[My Résumé\|My Résumé]].
Else, please keep reading.
