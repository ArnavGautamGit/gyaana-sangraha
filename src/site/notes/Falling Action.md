# Falling Action
> In Literature & Storytelling, the phase in the [[Storytelling Structure\|Storytelling Structure]] that lies after the [[Climax\|Climax]] and before the [[Resolution\|Resolution]] where the loose ends begin tying up and path to the end is clear in front of the character's minds.

Falling Action and [[Resolution\|Resolution]] occur at the same time or the line between the two is very fuzzy in many stories.

It is often one of the most overlooked part of a Story since it is linear and the audience's collective hearts are given a bit of a break from racing.
