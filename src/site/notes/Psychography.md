# Psychography
> A process of understanding and breaking down a person's [[Personality\|Personality]] to every square inch. It also includes breking down the person's interests, hobbies and other aspects of Psychology for comparitive study & categorisation similar to advanced Demographic Study based on Psychology of the individual.

I have broken down Personalities and Psychology of multiple individuals around me to the best of my ability.

Proper Psychographic analysis would include an understanding of likes and dislikes or a breakdown of the person's demographic analysis based on the same but in this Repository, when I mention "Psychography of XYZ person" I often mean that I break down their personality as if a Psychologist.

It is important to note that although I have a small background in Psychology since I learned basics of the subject as an elective in my Computer Science Engineering Degree, it is also important to note that I am no Psychologist & hence my words should not be taken as the Absolute Truth.

So don't be a Sith Lord in my Repository.
