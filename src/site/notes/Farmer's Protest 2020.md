# Farmer's Protest 2020
> The Protest of Farmers around the NCT of Delhi by blocking the highways for repealing some farm laws.

Let's reflect back on the farmers' protests of 2020-2021.

## ***What Happened***
The 2020–2021 farmers' protest was a demonstration against three farm acts that were passed by the Parliament of India in September 2020. The immediate demand of the farmers was the repeal of all the farm laws. However, as the protest progressed, additional demands were added over time, with the most important one being regarding the Minimum Support Price (MSP).

The three acts were as follows:

1. Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act: expands the scope of trade areas of farmers produce from select areas to "any place of production, collection, and aggregation." Allows electronic trading and e-commerce of scheduled farmers' produce. Prohibits state governments from levying any market fee, cess or levy on farmers, traders, and electronic trading platforms for a trade of farmers' produce conducted in an 'outside trade area'.

2. Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act: creates a framework for contract farming through an agreement between a farmer and a buyer before the production or rearing of any farm produces. It provides for a three-level dispute settlement mechanism: the conciliation board, Sub-Divisional Magistrate, and Appellate Authority.'

3. Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act: allows for the center to regulate certain food items in the course of extraordinary situations like war or famine. Requires that imposition of any stock limit on agricultural produce be based on price rise.

## ***Why it happened***
In summary, the three acts provide for the creation of an ecosystem for farmers and traders, for a national framework on farming agreements and further to amend the Essential Commodities Act, 1955#politics 

But why farmers protested against these acts? (while INC or Indian National Congress and other opposition parties supported them. [[Truth about Congress\|Truth about Congress]])

1. The farmer unions believe that the laws will open the sale and marketing of agricultural products outside the notified Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) mandis for farmers.

2. Further, the laws will allow inter-state trade encourage hike electronic trading of agricultural produce.

3. The new laws prevent the state governments from collecting a market fee, cess, or levy for trade outside the APMC markets; this has led the farmers to believe the laws will "gradually lead to the deterioration and ultimately end the mandi system" thus "leaving farmers at the mercy of corporates".

4. Further, the farmers believe that the laws will end their existing relationship with agricultural small-scale businessmen (commission agents who act as middlemen by providing financial loans, ensuring timely procurement, and promising adequate prices for their crop).

## ***My verdict after self-reflection***
However, upon reflection, it may seem that the reasons stated above for the protest sound misguided. These farm acts could potentially benefit small farmers by providing them access to open markets and allowing duty-free e-trading. It would also enable farmers to sell their goods across state borders.

Therefore, looking back at these protests, it appears that they were mainly led by wealthy farmers from Punjab, Haryana, and Western UP who were against open markets and the involvement of corporates in agriculture. It gives the impression that these farmers were opposed to small farmers benefiting from e-commerce and the involvement of corporates, as well as breaking free from the exploitation of middlemen. Moreover, their concerns about the APMC being shut down were based on false insecurities. Isn't it unreasonable to protest due to such insecurities?

## ***My Conclusion***
This country will never become an upper middle income country without the passing of the farm laws. You cannot continue growing if 60% of your population is in the agricultural sector, and that sector is under protectionist policies. If 60% of the people in a $3.75T economy can only manage to generate $19 billion dollars, then there's something clearly wrong with it, and the people who openly support the existing policies and are against the open market Liberalisation, are the people who want to keep these people in poverty.
