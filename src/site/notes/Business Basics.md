# Business Basics
> Summary of everything I learnt about Business from my Father.

I wanted to learn bits about Business and understand business as a whole before I even thought of making a decision on whetehr I should go for an MBA. Before spending money on admission, before spending my time preparing for CAT I need to first understand what business is and if it is worth my time.

Here in this note, I link to all other notes (like a map of content) that I make about Business & all the things I have learnt about Business from my father.
