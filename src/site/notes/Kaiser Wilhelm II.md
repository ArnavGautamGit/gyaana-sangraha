# Kaiser Wilhelm II
> Ruler of the German Empire from 1888-1918.

After Germnay was reunified in 1871, there was a man who soon became the leader of unified Germany - Kaiser Wilhelm The Second.

The man was aggressive in strategies and had an expansionist foreign policy. It seems that he understood that to prevent Germany from being fractured again, he needs to make his Empire stronger & the only way there was to do so was to colonise other territories - the closest landmass to coastal Europe being Africa since getting to Asia required going through the Russian Empire & its vassals which the Czar wouldn't allow.
