# Stream your D&D campaign
Streaming your D&D campaign can earn you quite some money if done right and for long enough with good consistency.

Probably will not help you earn a lot of money but it is what it is.

### Equipment Needed
1. Laptops for everyone (Desktops with mic work as well)
2. Good Copyright-free music from D&D
3. Maps & VTTs from [[Inkarnate\|Inkarnate]] or [[Roll20\|Roll20]]
4. Character Sheets made on D&D Beyond
5. OBS Studio Background Images and Overlays

I have thought to not stream any of my campaigns where they are not comfortable with sharing either their voice or face or both.

# Footnotes
1. For Overlays on OBS or Streamlabs OBS: [YT Tutorial on no-face style](https://youtu.be/IuoBFnahIvA?feature=shared)
2. For Individual Character models: [YT Tutorial on Individual Character Designs](https://youtu.be/tyXrgLHzcMU?feature=shared) 
	1. You will have to do this for each player and all players have to be online on Discord for their characters to even be visible.
	2. I should look for those updated ones which are not based on PNGTube Plus or whatever BS subscription model based shite they have implemented for stupid Americans.
