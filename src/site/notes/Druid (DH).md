# Druid (DH)
> A [[DH Character Creation#Character Class\|Character Class]] of a forst-dwelling and nature-loving, shape-shifters who can take the form of a beast & gain any temporary [[Hit Point Slots\|Hit Point Slots]] if specific rules such as [[Druid (DH)#Druid's Hope - Special Ability\|Druid's Hope]] are leveraged.

Druids in [[Daggerheart\|Daggerheart]], live in small closed settlements and are oblivious to the details of how society at large works. For reference, take [[Critical Role\|Critical Role]] Campaign 3's druid character played by Ashley.

Optimise your character around the [[Instinct\|Instinct]] Trait.

### Domains
Domains of a Class  decide the domain cards (and abilities) one gets to pick up.
Each class has 2 fixed Domains.
The Druid's domains are: [[Sage\|Sage]] and [[Arcana\|Arcana]].

### Base Scores
Base [[Evasion Score\|Evasion Score]]: 8
Major Damage Threshold: 7
Severe Damage Threshold: 14

### Class Items
Each Class also has a specific item they can choose to have - and they will become plot points in the story. They must have one of two.
For a Druid, choose between EITHER a *Small Bag of Rocks & Bones* OR a *Strange Pendant Found in the Dirt*.

### Druid's Hope - Special Ability

Druid can use these 3x [[Hope Token\|Hope Token]] while in Beastform to increase your Damage Thresholds by +3 until you drop the form.

### Class Features - Wildtouch & Beastform
The Druid is one of the few classes in Daggerheeart which have more than one Class Feature. The two class features being: Wildtouch and Beastform.
- ***Wildtouch***: Perform a harmless, subtle effects (that involve nature) at will. Like making a flower grow or bloom instantly, start a campfire etc.
- ***Beastform***: Mark a stress to into magical creature of your choice from the Beastform list (Homebrew allowed on [[Game Master (GM)\|GM]]'s prior approval). This form still allows you to freely mark [[Armour Points\|Armour Points]] & the form is immediately dropped on the last [[Stress Point\|Stress Point]] or [[Hit Point Slots\|HP Slot]] marked.
