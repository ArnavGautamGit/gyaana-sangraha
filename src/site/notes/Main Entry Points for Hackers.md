> Points which Hackers can use to enter the Computer Systems or [[Computer Networks\|Computer Networks]] to attack or damage them, their users or their assets.

Using that knowledge, for an [[Online Cyber Attack\|Online Cyber Attack]] coming from the open Internet, the attackers have to enter through the Internet Router i.e., beat the [[Firewall\|Firewall]], [[Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IDPS)\|IDPS]] and other things or try a [[Local Cyber Attack\|Local Cyber Attack]] via the local Wi-Fi of the target after getting the target. For an [[Offline Cyber Attack\|Offline Cyber Attack]], there can be Hardware-based attacks like accessing the USB ports on the network PCs or the USB ports on the server.

### Conclusion
These are the following "Entry Points":
1. Code Vulnerabilities on Software Product/Service like vulnerability to [[SQL Injection Attack\|SQL Injection Attack]] or [[DOS Attack\|DOS Attack]].
2. Internet Router due to inadequate router protection from an [[Online Cyber Attack\|Online Cyber Attack]].
