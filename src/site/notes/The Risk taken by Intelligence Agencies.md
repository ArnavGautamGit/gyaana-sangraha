# The Risk taken by Intelligence Agencies
Many Inteligence Agencies go through the trouble of getting their agents/spies a cover story, teach them about local nuances instead of just the language of the target country/community.
Some may go to lengths of securing them citizenship.

A lot of the times, the spies may change their mind through the long process, quit mid-way, chicken out at the time of the entry or something else. Through the years this process may take a decade! The reward that the person may find employement in area of interest.

During this process, there may be people who abscond after reaching the target country - they may have changed their mind, may have fallen in love, or is finding the new horizons offered by the adopted country lucrative - may be even possible out of boredom.

Due to these risks involved, agencies prefer to raise sources among the people who are already citizens/part of the target country/community respectively. Usually people with credible standing with the people in places of interest.
