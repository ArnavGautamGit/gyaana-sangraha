# Saptānga Theory
> Small section of the [[Kautilya Arthashāstra\|Kautilya Arthashāstra]] which lists the 7 essential parts of a successful state where it could mean dissolution if even one is missing/weak.

Saptānga Theory was also written by [[Vishnugupta Chanakya\|Vishnugupta Chanakya]] for internal governance while the International Relations were handled by the [[Mandala Theory\|Mandala Theory]]. Both of these theories help run the [[Mauryan Empire\|Mauryan Empire]] and other kingdoms for the next 1000 years in derivative wisdom & works.

### Swāmi
The centre of the entire theory is the Swāmi (also called as "Samrāta") which is a [[Sanskrit\|Sanskrit]] term for "Lord" or "Master" which here refers to the Emperor. The theory depends entirely on the Emperor being competant, smart & protected from assassination (or similar threats)

### Āmatya
Second essential part comprises of the Āmatya (Sanskrit Term for "Minister") are those people from the noble class or the royal family who hold specific expertise on particular topics to act as advisors to the King - it is noted that having good Āmatya does not absolve the emperor from at least having a surface level knowledge of all things needed to know about their kingdom. Each Amatya has his own set of advisors called "Adhyaksha" (Secretary)

### Janapada
Third essential is Janapada (territory & land) which was important for produce & Economy (the main subject of author [[Vishnugupta Chanakya\|Vishnugupta Chanakya]]'s expertise)

### Durga
Fourth essential was [[Durga (Indian Forts)\|Durga (Indian Forts)]] on important trade routes & strategic locations such as hilltops which were essential for security of the region - in turn securing the Swāmi.

### Danda/Bala
Fifth essential was the Danda (Punishment) or Bala (Strength) both referring to the size & strength of the Military which occupies the Durga.

### Kosha
Sixth essential is Kosha (Treasury) which pays for it all - the types of Tax were Bali (traditional voluntary economic sacrifice since the [[Indian Vedic Period\|Vedic Period]]) with two new types of taxes on Income and sale of [[Goods\|Goods]] respectively called as Bhāga (portion) and Shulka (tarriff). It was seen that while Income Tax (Bhāga) was fixed at one-fourth of total income, Shulka varried between one-fifth and one-twentyfifth of the total invoice value. 

### Mitra
Seventh and the final essential is Mitra (Ally) which refers to an Ally state which can provide something in the time of dire need. When push comes to shove, this guy can bail you out. It is recommended to maintain cordial relations with even those countries you plan to annex since that means you can take their help from time to time, reducing the burden on your Kosha and the element of surprise when you invade is worth every penny. This is the prime reason [[Chandragupta Maurya\|Chandragupta Maurya]] kept cordial relations with [[Selucus I Nicator\|Selucus I Nicator]] & [[Selucid Empire\|Selucid Empire]].
