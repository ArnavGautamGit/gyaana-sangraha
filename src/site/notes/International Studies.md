# International Studies
> Also known by other names such as Global Politics, International Politics and International Relations with minor differences between them - International Studies is a subject which studies the ways in how States are supposed to interact and work vs how they actually work.

> Here, International Studies refers to a subject in the 8th semester (Last Semester) of my B.Tech Computer Science Engineering Degree at Jaypee Institute of Information Technology.

The Subject is taught by the new Guest Lecturer, Dr. George Kutty. He is originally from Kerela but living near Mayur Vihar Pocket - 1 Metro Station in Delhi (probably on rent i am guessing). He has a great way of teaching. He made me enthusiastic about the subject. In the same semester, he was also teaching "Global Politics" to Junior Students.
