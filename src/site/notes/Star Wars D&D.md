# Star Wars: Stories of Old Republic (SWSOR)
I play in [this D&D Discord Server](https://discord.gg/swsor) but it is set in the Star Wars Universe! It is set in the Old Republic Era and I tend to stick to Canon stuff although sometimes Legends is referred to in case Canon does not have enough information about it.

***==The current year in-lore==***: 12 ATC (this year ends and 13 ATC starts around 15th May 2025)
