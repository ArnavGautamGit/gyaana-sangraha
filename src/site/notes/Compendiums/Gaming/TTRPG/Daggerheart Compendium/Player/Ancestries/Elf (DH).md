# Elf (DH)
> A [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Ancestries/DH Species Ancestry\|DH Species Ancestry]] of humanoids with distinctly pointed ears, attuned senses and attractively thin build.

The Elf ears become less stiff as they age and eventually the tips begin to droop as the Elf becomes a senior citizen after the age of 325. Elves may have long, short, thin or wide ears with any number of decorations or piercings on them as they like.

On choosing Elf, you get the following Ancestry Feature:
- ***Quick Reactions***: You can mark 1x [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Stress Point\|Stress Point]] to take advantage on a Reaction Roll.
- ***Celestial Trance***: Step into a trance & take an extra downtime move.

Lifespan of an average Elf: 350 years.

> [!tip] TIP: Leverage Common Fantasy Tropes (tastefully)
> Common Fantasy Trope is that Dwarves and [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Ancestries/Elf (DH)\|Elves]] do not like each other. When playing a dwarf, think of how it is only Logical that Elves are complete polar opposites of you. When playing Elf, consider how the Dwarves being covered in hair (even on the face) can be seen as unhygenic by Elves who barely grow facial hair, even for men!
> Do not go berserk against a fellow Elf though (player character or NPC) but you can include a curious question about Hair in the conversation somewhere.
