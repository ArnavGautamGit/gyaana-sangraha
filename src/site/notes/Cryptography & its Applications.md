# Cryptography & its Applications
> A Subject in the 7th Semester of my Computer Science Degree at Jaypee Institute of Information Technology (JIIT), Noida.

The Subject is taught by Himanshu Agrawal Sir, whose teaching ability is good but his teaching style is lazy. He often explains only the simple parts of a topic and leave the rest saying "I am sure you can do this" and that part is the part generally asked in the Exams - ruining the grades of everyone.
