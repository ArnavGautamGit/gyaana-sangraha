# Yōga
> The meaning of the Sanskrit term "योग" which means the connection or meeting of two things. 
> The general connotation is to do one's work with such devotion as if the soul of the human merged with God i.e., such devoted work that people reviewing or seeing your work feel so mesmerised that they come to the conclusion that there must be a divine touch to it. 

The word "Yōga" is used in a myriad of different ways - some may use it in connection to Meditation and "exercise" while others may use the word in reference to the Hindu Darshana (Perspective) which is of the same name. Many may look at how Yōga is referenced in the [[Shrimad-Bhagavad Gītā\|Shrimad-Bhagavad Gītā]] & its aid in taking action.

### For Meditation
The part of Yōga that has been reduced to an exercise routine for oldies - it is a practice of calming the mind to bring stability and to facilitate clarity of thought. This practice is what is called "Meditation" to help arrive at a conclusion after clarity of thought is achieved. 

### For Philosophy
Once the calm, tranquil state of mind is achieved, the conclusions people arrive at after intense introspection while in this meditative state are also called "Meditations" although these meditations are philosophical - meaning of life, death, the universe are discussed - these discussions are what laid the foundations for [[Yōga (Philosophy)\|Yōga Darshana]].

### For Taking Action
[[Lord Krishna\|Lord Krishna]] guided many of his followers via the [[Shrimad-Bhagavad Gītā\|Shrimad-Bhagavad Gītā]] and [[Arjuna\|Arjuna]] that doing your [[Karma (कर्म)\|Karma (कर्म)]] must be one's paramount [[Dharma (धर्म)\|Dharma (धर्म)]] unless it is a situation where an injustice has been committed then your Dharma is to correct it - although such cases are rare.
