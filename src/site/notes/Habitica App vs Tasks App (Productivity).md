# Habitica App vs Tasks App (Productivity)
There is a big uproar in Psychology community regarding Gamified Productivity, a notion that productivity increases if productivity-tracking is gamified. Many people believe that it is the initial breadth of fresh air which drives these studies since they are done for a short time frame.

So naturally, there is a big clash between Habitica (representing gamified productivity) and Tasks.org App (representing serious productivity).

The Comparison between the two is very simple and straight forward. I compared the features and offerings in both the apps in the following section.

### Habitica
✅ Offers a segregated list of To-Do, Recurring Tasks (branded as *Dailies*) and Habits.
✅ Offers users a way to reward themselves with custom rewards when they do well.
✅ Unchecked Recurring Tasks (*Dailies*) get cancelled & reduce health (consequence).
✅ Allows teaming up with friends for accountability partnerships.
✅ Easy to use for a new user due to easily available tutorials.
🟰 Cross-Platform. Can be used both on phone and PC. (matter of preference)
❌ Too many RPG options clutter the UI (armour & weapons is enough)
❌ Has a paid tier (i.e., NOT Free & Open Source)
❌ When Habitica servers are down, the app doesn't work. (got frequent in 2024)
❌ Does not Natively allow priority based sorting (possible using "Tags")

### Tasks.org App
✅ Free & Open Source.
✅ Syncs with Google Calendar and other Digital Calendars.
✅ Cleaner Interface (due to no gamified stats to showcase).
✅ One-hand friendly since the UI elements are mostly at the bottom of the screen.
✅ Natively allows priority-based sorting since all tasks have priority rating.
✅ Specific List named "Today" allows checking all the tasks for THAT day.
✅ More advanced & fine-tuned settings available.
🟰 Better Security (all your data on one device, if you prefer that).
❌ Recurring Tasks (*Dailies*) cannot be marked "missed" (no consequence).
❌ Tags (in this app) are useless if lists are segregated.
❌ No option for ANY rewards.
❌ Multiple lists confuses a new user.
❌ No available tutorials on YouTube. (or not as many as Habitica - which itself is small)
❌ Not available for iOS.
