# Anti-Fragile & Resilient Thought-Process
> A Mindset change that incorporates the following list to always be like water which takes the shape of any container and can navigate problems in life.:
> - [[Books Library/Related Notes/Wabi-Sabi (Japanese Concept)\|Wabi-Sabi (Japanese Concept)]]
> - [[Books Library/Related Notes/Ichi-go, Ichi-e (Japanese Concept)\|Ichi-go, Ichi-e (Japanese Concept)]]

The premise is simple and can be broken into the following steps:
- By using the concept of [[Books Library/Related Notes/Wabi-Sabi (Japanese Concept)\|Wabi-Sabi]], recognise that nothing is permanent.
- Once we know that nothing is permanent, make a list of backup options for certain important things in your life.
	- If you lose your job, what is the Plan B? Do we have a Contingency Plan?
	- Similarly, if you are investing and one of your [[Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs)\|SIPs]] are not doing well... what about that?
- Never be dependent on one thing: always have backups.
- When you have options, when you have backups and the lower levels of your [[Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs\|Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs]] is fulfilled - it will be easier to follow [[Books Library/Related Notes/Stoicism\|Stoicism]] and the teachings of the [[Books Library/Shrimad-Bhagavad G카t훮\|Shrimad-Bhagavad G카t훮]].
