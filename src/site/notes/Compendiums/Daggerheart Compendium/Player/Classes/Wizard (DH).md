# Wizard (DH)
> A [[Compendiums/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/DH Character Creation#Character Class\|Character Class]] of strong spellcasters who using their Knowledge have acquired immensely powerful spells. Optimise the character by investing in [[Knowledge\|Knowledge]].

Wizards are magical spellcasters who absolutely nail the spellcasting bit. Prioritise the [[Knowledge\|Knowledge]] since that is your spellcasting trait & choose either a Greatstaff or wand as your weapon.

### Domains
Domains of a class decide the Domain Cards (and abilities) one gets to pick up.
Each Class has 2 fixed Domains.
The Wizard's domains are: [[Codex\|Codex]] and [[Splendor\|Splendor]].

### Base Scores
Base [[Compendiums/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Evasion Score\|Evasion Score]]: 10
Base [[Compendiums/Daggerheart Compendium/General/Hit Point Slots\|Hit Point Slots]]: 5

### Class Items
Each Class has a specific item they choose which will be a plot point in the story. They
must choose one of the options.
For a Warrior, choose EITHER *"Book you're trying to translate"* OR *"Tiny & Harmless Elemental Pet"*

### Wizard's Hope - Special Ability
***Not This Time:*** Spend 3x [[Hope Token\|Hope Token]] to force an adversary within Far Range to reroll an attack or damage roll.

### Class Feature
***Prestidigitation*** allows you to perform simple harmless magic at will. Like change an object's colour and give off a smell, light a candle etc..

***Strange Patterns*** allows the Wizard to choose a number between 1 to 12. Whenever you roll that number on either Duality Dice, gain a [[Hope Token\|Hope Token]] or clear a [[Compendiums/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Stress Point\|Stress Point]]. This number will change at Long Rest.

### Class Foundations (Subclasses)
There are two subclasses for the Wizard - either School of War or School of Knowledge depending on Playstyle. Both use [[Knowledge\|Knowledge]] as Spellcasting Trait

- ***==School of Knowledge==*** are the studious Wizards who have great knowledge of Magic and the world around them.
	- ***Foundation Feature***
		- ***Prepared:*** Take an additional domain card of your level or lower from a domain you have access to.
		- **Adept**: Mark a [[Compendiums/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Stress Point\|Stress Point]] to use an Experience instead of a [[Hope Token\|Hope Token]], when you use this Feature, your Experience Modifier is doubled for tht roll.

- ***==School of War==*** is a subclass which uses magic for War almost exclusively.
