# FAT (File System)
> Also called FAT32, it is a type of [[File System Structure\|File System Structure]] that compromises on [[Cyber Security (CyberSec)\|Cyber Security]] to allow it to be cross-platform across various [[Operating System\|Operating Systems]].

FAT32 File System works across [[Microsoft Windows\|Microsoft Windows]], [[MacOS X\|MacOS X]] and all distributions of [[Linux\|Linux]] but it is often used for storage under or equal to 32 GB (hence the 32 in the name) i.e., Flash Storage like Pendrives.

Although nowadays, it is noted that FAT can be used beyond 32 GB and hence 32 is not used a lot except some legacy systems or people that cannot let go of the 32 either due to habit or for diambiguation (i.e., avoid confusion with obesity).
