# Net Asset Value (NAV)
> Price of an Individual Unit of a [[Mutual Funds\|Mutual Fund]] which is the analogous to the Share Price of a Share in the Stock Market i.e., it is variable and can give us the total Mutual Fund Corpus when multiplied with the number of Units.

NAV is calculated by using the following formula:
$$\Large NAV = \dfrac{Mutual \ Fund \ Size}{Number \ of \ units}$$
It is important to note that out of the total amount invested, [[Expense Ratio\|Expense Ratio]] is first deducted before NAVs are purchased. 
To check the true profit yield of the Mutual Fund, check the "Profit on NAV" instead of "Profit" since the latter would also include the Expense Ratio and give you a false image.
