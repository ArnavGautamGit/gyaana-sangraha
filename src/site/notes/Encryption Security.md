# Encryption Security
> A measure of the level of security any of the used [[Cryptographic Encryption Algorithms\|Cryptographic Encryption Algorithms]] provide to the users.

In 1949, [[Claude Shannon\|Claude Shannon]] proposed certain characteristics whuich make a good Encryption Algorithm:
1. The level of secrecy should dictate the level of encryption security. More Secrecy means better encryption.
2. Enciphering Algorithm and the set of keys must be free from complexity
3. implementation of the [[Cyber Security Principles\|Cyber Security Principles]] must be as simple as possible.
4. Errors in Encryption must not corrupt the data
5. size of encrypted data = sixe of original data

It is also said that a trustworthy encryption must be based on sound mathematics, verified by competant experts and should have stood the test of time.

An Encryption is considered unbreakable as long as it does not provide enough practical means and/or time to break the said encryption. [[OTPs (One-Time Passwords)\|OTPs (One-Time Passwords)]] work on this principle of not providing enough time to break/get the OTP unless you are using other methods
