# Cryptographer vs Cryptanalyst
At first glance, both the Cryptographer and the Cryptanalyst are suppose to decipher the data from the message. Then how are they different?

| Cryptographer                                                                                   | Cryptanalyst                                                                                                                     |

| Cryptographer is a person who encrypts message with a key to use encryption to conceal the text | A Cryptanalyst studies encryption and encrypted messages in an attempt to translate the coded material back to its original form |
| Cryptographers generally work for the legitimate senders                                        | Cryptanalysts usually work on the behalf of some unauthorised interceptor                                                        |
| Want to get message to the receiver safely.                                                     | Want to either block, intercept, modify or fabricate the message.                                                                |

Cryptanalyst wishes to convert the encryptd text back into its original form. Generally, this technique is used by unauthorused intruders.
