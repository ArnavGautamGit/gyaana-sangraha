# DH Species Ancestry
In [[Daggerheart\|Daggerheart]], there are many different Species/Races that exist. It is interesting to note that there is an assumption that all species/races speak a common language and hence there are no language rules in the game. The Sign Language is also Universal and understood by everyone.

It is upto the GM if they want to hombrew languages for regions or races or if they wish to have the languages be known or everyone uses magic to understand each other regardless of language.

The List of Species/Races in [[Daggerheart\|Daggerheart]] are:
- [[Clank (DH)\|Clank (DH)]] - the automaton or robot like beings in Fantasy
- [[Drakona (DH)\|Drakona (DH)]] - Dragon-like Humanoid beings (equivalent of [[Dragonborn (D&D)\|Dragonborn (D&D)]])
- [[Dwarf (DH)\|Dwarf (DH)]] - bearded and short-heighted humanoids (equivalent of [[Dwarf (D&D)\|Dwarf (D&D)]])
- [[Elf (DH)\|Elf (DH)]] - Tolkien-like Elves, exact equivalent of D&D elf vareity depends on the exact chosen [[DH Community Heritage\|DH Community Heritage]] and location.
- [[Faerie (DH)\|Faerie (DH)]] - Fairy but Daggerheart.
- [[Faun (DH)\|Faun (DH)]] - 
- [[Firebolg (DH)\|Firebolg (DH)]]
- [[Fungril (DH)\|Fungril (DH)]]
- [[Galapa (DH)\|Galapa (DH)]]
- [[Giant (DH)\|Giant (DH)]]
- [[Goblin (DH)\|Goblin (DH)]]
- [[Human (DH)\|Human (DH)]]
- [[Inferis (DH)\|Inferis (DH)]]
- [[Katari (DH)\|Katari (DH)]]
- [[Orc (DH)\|Orc (DH)]]
- [[Ribbet (DH)\|Ribbet (DH)]]
- [[Simiah (DH)\|Simiah (DH)]]

Please note that Mixed Ancestries are possible.
### Mixed Ancestries
Formed after a union of people with different ancestry and the child being born of such a union will carry a mixed genome.
In case of egg-laying species like Drakona forming a union with an Elf, they will need Magic to get an offspring.
