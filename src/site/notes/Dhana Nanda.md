# Dhana Nanda
> The second and the last of [[Nanda Empire\|Nanda Empire]]. He ruled in a time when his Dynasty had reached its peak & since he was born in affluence unlike his father, it is said that he was an arrogant king often disliked by the commoners for excessive taxation & his disrespectful behaviour in court.

It is said that [[Alexander The Great\|Alexander The Great]] (who controlled the Kashmir & Punjab regions along with many regions to the west of the [[Aravali Hills\|Aravali Hills]]) could not fight the Nandas & we could have won back our territory but a King like Dhana Nanda born in Royalty would not want to - due to having no connect with the people he rules over.

### Speedrunning his own decline
It is also said that Dhana Nanda signing a peace pact with [[Alexander The Great\|Alexander The Great]] did not go down nicely with [[Vishnugupta Chanakya\|Vishnugupta Chanakya]] (a professor of Economics at [[Takshila University\|Takshila University]]) since he thought that the Nanda Empire left a major site of Indian Culture under the influence of greeks and the ancient university of Takshila is now at the mercy of outsiders. Chanakya did raise this point in Dhana Nanda's court and instead got humiliated, assaulted and dragged out of court by his [[Shikhā\|Shikhā]]. This is where Chanakya decided that he will posit on the throne a suitable king who will kick out the Greeks & push back [[Selucus I Nicator\|Selucus I Nicator]] off the Indian subcontinent.
