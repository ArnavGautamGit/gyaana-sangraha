# Idealism
> In [[International Studies\|International Studies]], it is defined as an inherently [[Optimism\|Optimistic]] Philosophy which is also often used in International Studies to describe behaviour where one State which behaves in accordance with all the relevant International UN Charters & Resolutions as they blindly expect the other State to do the same.

It stemmed from an expectation from states to act Ideally in the early days of the formation of the [[United Nations (U.N)\|United Nations (U.N)]] (and it still is such today) however in the contemporary times, states expect others to talk in an Ideal manner whereas they themselves do not wish to do the same.

It could be argued that Idealism is based on [[Optimism\|Optimism]].
