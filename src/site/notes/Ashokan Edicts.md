# Ashokan Edicts
> Note on all the Rock Edicts and Pillar Edicts erected on Emperor [[Ashoka\|Ashoka]]'s command.

Ashoka's Edicts can be classified into 3 categories: Rock Edicts (major and Minor), Pillar Edicts (major & minor) along with a few Cave Inscriptions he ordered. Chronologically, the first of his edicts were bilingual in [[Greek\|Greek]] and [[Aramaic\|Aramaic]] - erected in the [[Indo-Greeks\|Indo-Greek]] dominated regions of present-day Afghanistan. I have visited the [[Ashokan Rock Edicts in Kālsi, Uttarakhand\|Ashokan Rock Edicts in Kālsi, Uttarakhand]] which (like most of his edicts) use the [[Brāhmi Script\|Brāhmi Script]] and [[Prakrit\|Prakrit]] Language (apart from the ones near Kandahar and other parts of Afghanistan which used the [[Kharoshti Script\|Kharoshti Script]]).

### Content of Edicts
The Edicts essentially pleaded to the subjects on how they should live a life with a lifestyle that corresponds to Buddhist ideals which are already quite similar to Hindu teachings of [[Dharma (धर्म)\|Dharma (धर्म)]] in many aspects such as violence being the last option & avoiding harm to animals - including calling Meat Consumption a Tamasic practice.

Through his edicts, [[Ashoka\|Ashoka]] preached to his subjects to avoid meat-eating and promote non-violence (similar to his [[Ashokan Rock Edicts in Kālsi, Uttarakhand\|edicts I have visited]]) among other Buddhist ideals. This is one of the regions why the Indian Gangetic Plains do not have any edicts & the few edicts that are in North India are all in meat-eating tribal regions like Jaunsar (of which [[Kālsi (कालसी)\|Kālsi (कालसी)]] is a part) 

### Who is Priyadasi? 
Apart from a few minor edicts, most of his edicts did not mention Ashoka by name - they mentioned "Devanam Piyadasi", "Devanam Priyadasi Raja", "Priyadarshi" and similar variantions depending upon the language used.

It was British Archaeologist [[James Princep\|James Princep]] in 1837 who decoded and deduced that Priyadasi was not a different king but Ashoka himself - since it is a custom in both Hinduism and Buddhism of become a [[Dvija\|Dvija]] or "twice-born" and changing their name to reflect the beginning of a new life when the person begins their spiritual/religious education. It is unclear whether this name comes from becoming Dvija after starting Hindu education or the name-change comes from his Buddhist education. It could also be that Priyadasi could be Ashoka's real name given by his parents.
