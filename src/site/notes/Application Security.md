# Application Security
> The study and field of work dealing with assessment of security measures applied to protect [[Software Applications\|Apps]] from unauthorised access, tamper, deletion or any act that may compromise the App's [[Objectives of Cyber Security\|CIA Triad]]. Often involves ramping up of security whenever required.

Even though [[App Development\|App Development]] is generally used solely for Mobile Apps, it is not the case with Application Security since it deals with all forms of [[Software Applications\|Software Applications]].

### Scope
The Scope of AppSec usually goes into studying the weaknesses or vulnerabilities of the system and then suggesting changes or edits. These edits made to the software program's code are performed by the Developers. Effectively, for CyberSec professionals, their jobs end right after they submit the report detailing weaknesses and vulnerabilities.

### Finding Weaknesses & Vulnerabilities
Weaknesses & Vulnerabilities can be found in a few different ways. The first one includes performing a [[Penetration Testing\|PenTest]] with the other involving [[Vulnerability Scanning\|Vulnerability Scanning]]. The third option is to do both one after another.
