# Ranger (DH)
> A [[DH Character Creation#Character Class\|Character Class]] of a protector of the wilderness and their home forest. A brilliant Navigator seen most commonly wielding a bow - The Ranger in [[Daggerheart\|Daggerheart]], similar to their [[Ranger (D&D)\|D&D equivalent]] is a useful ally to have as they are accustomed to fight without the support of an organised military, form great tacticians and use Guerilla Warfare at their finest.

Due to their knowledge of their home surroundings, a small group of rangers using their guerilla tactics can prove to be a nightmare for any invaders, no matter how many are there. Optimise by prioritising [[Agility\|Agility]].
