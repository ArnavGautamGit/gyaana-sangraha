# Magical Woods
> Forest Location in [[Lurov\|Lurov]] with [[Owlesia\|Owlesia]] to its North East and [[Eastern Desert\|Eastern Desert]] to its south across the swamps.

Magical Woods have historically been dominated by [[Compendiums/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Ancestries/Ribbet (DH)\|Ribbet]], [[Compendiums/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Ancestries/Galapa (DH)\|Galapa]] and [[Compendiums/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Ancestries/Simiah (DH)\|Simiah]] with Ribbets and Galapa forming the ethnic majority in the northern half due to more oak trees while southern half being majorly Simiah and the government was run by a joint council of the tribe leaders in the capital city of [[Ribbetton\|Ribbetton]] situated on the northern-most tip.

Some time ago, Simiah were manipulated by the [[Miragerie\|Miragerie]] Orcs to make them break away from the council and join their sphere of influence - it would allow the orcs to gain some influence and build their own small town of [[Vranik (Lurov)\|Vranik]] in here. Proxy war shook the forests as there was a north-south division. It depends on the player & party vibes if I decide we start from after or during the proxy war - which is why I should raise this on the [[Compendiums/Daggerheart Compendium/Safety Tools/Session Zero\|Session Zero]] of [[Storms of Eslance\|Storms of Eslance]] regardless of the system we use.
