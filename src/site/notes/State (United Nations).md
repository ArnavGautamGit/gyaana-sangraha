# State (United Nations)
> The State as defined by the [[Charter of the United Nations (1945)\|Charter of the United Nations (1945)]] is a body which comprises of the following aspects:
> - Territory
> - Government
> - Sovereignity
> - Fixed Population

However it must be noted that with time there were additions and changes that were made in this definition with following meetings and agreements prompted by situations which required a change in the rules. These specific "interpretation" of the rules are known as [[State (United Nations)#Detailed Nuances\|Nuances]]. It is important to note that I am neither a Student of "International Law" nor is India a signatory of the International Law (as of 15th January 2025).

### Detailed Nuances
Territory is defined as the area enclosed within the [[Airspace\|Airspace]], Land Borders and [[Maritime Borders\|Maritime Borders]] of the State which is controlled by the Government of a State recognised by the United Nations.

The Government can be any form of Government from Democracy to Dictatorship - including even Monarchy given that it can prove support from the majority of the States and the citizens of the proposed State.

In United Nations Charters, State is often referred to as "Member State". Since membership of the UN is required to be recognised as a State.

The Fixed Population in the UN charter is defined as the minimum number of fixed people that live in that piece of land. Theoretically, this allows the number to be Zero - as long as it can be proven as the same (which is why countries maintain a Census).
