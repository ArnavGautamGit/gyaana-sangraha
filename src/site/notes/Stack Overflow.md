# Stack Overflow
> A special condition of [[Buffer Overflow\|Buffer Overflow]] where the user enters data that exceeds the memory limit for the input buffer (here implemented as a stack). 
> It may also be performed as an Exploit to overwrite data.

Non-malicious Stack Overflow which happen for genuine reason & not due to a cyber attack are often generated by a runaway recursion or allocated large data structures on the stack. 

If a program does not properly check array bounds, it may be possible to give the program specially crafted input that overwrites the return address with a binary value. 
In malicious or intentional Stack Overflow Exploits, the attackers try to find values which can wreck the system's or application's stack.

### Prevention
- Avoid [[Dangerous C and C++ Functions\|Dangerous C and C++ Functions]]
- Follow [[Good Software Engineering Practices\|Good Software Engineering Practices]]
- Compiler Tools like Stack Guard
- Use of [[Stack Canary\|Stack Canaries]]
