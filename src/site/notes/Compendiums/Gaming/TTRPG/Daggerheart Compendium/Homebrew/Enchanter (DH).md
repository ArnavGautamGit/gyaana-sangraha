# Enchanter (DH)
> A ***HOMEBREW*** [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/DH Character Creation#Character Class\|Character Class]] in [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/Daggerheart\|Daggerheart]] that I made to accomodate more players.
> Enchanters are a class of individuals who can easily enchant & influence people. They may live anywhere & can utilise a Beastform like a [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Classes/Druid (DH)\|Druid (DH)]] while having a charismatic presence of a [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Classes/Bard (DH)\|Bard (DH)]].

The only restriction on Beastform is that the Enchanter can only Beastform into ONE singular beast, there are no options. The player has to specify which beast they want to have as their singular Beastform.

### Domains
Domains of a Class decide the domain cards (and abilities) one gets to pick up.  
Each class has 2 fixed Domains.
The Enchanter's domains are: [[Sage\|Sage]] and [[Grace\|Grace]].

### Base Scores
Base Evasion Score: 10

### Class Items
Each Class also has a specific non-combat item they can choose to have - and these items will become plot points in the story so prepare a story for how the Enchanter got it. They must have one. 
Since this is a Homebrewed Class, I will allow any non-combat item.

### Enchanter's Hope - Special Ability
Enchanter's special ability that uses 3x [[Hope Token\|Hope Token]].
Enchanter can spend 3x [[Hope Token\|Hope Token]] to charm a maximum of 2 NPCs at any time with no rolls required.

### Class Feature - Rally
Please see the [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Classes/Bard (DH)#Class Feature - Rally\|Bard's Class Feature]] as it is the same here.

### Class Foundations (Subclasses)
Each class has a certain number of subclasses to choose from. For an enchanter, we have the following options:
- ***==Warden of the Elements==*** gives the option to the players to embody the natural elements of nature and play Support. Spellcasting trait for this subclass is [[Instinct\|Instinct]].
