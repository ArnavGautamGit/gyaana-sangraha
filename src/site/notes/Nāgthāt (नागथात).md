# Nāgthāt (नागथात)
A strategic town located higher up at the banks of the Yamuna. It is strategically placed such that if we want to supply water to any visible town to the North of Nāgthāt, you will have to pump the water upto the Nāgthāt ridge and supply to all the rest of the towns.

It is also on a junction between other smaller  towns like Dwīna, Bisoi among others which made it evolve into a location where people take a rest - an old lodging town between two big towns. Probably the plains and Uttarkashi or Kedarnath apart from nearby town. 

It is a strategic town nonetheless.
And a beautiful one too.

Nāgthāt got its name from the Ancient [[Nāga (deity) \| Nāga]] Temple present here - the name means "village of the Nāgas"
