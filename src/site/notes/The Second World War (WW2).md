# The Second World War (WW2)
> A War fought from 1939-1945 in Western Europe, Eastern Europe and the Indo-Pacific region between Allied Powers and Axis Powers 

The War was instrumental in taking the Military Capability and Standards to the higher level with innovations in Armoured Vehicles, Tanks and even Submarines (also called as U-Boats).

The Financial Losses incurred by all colonisers led to many larger colonies gaining Independence since the Europeans had de-industrialised them all long ago and maintaining a colony post-WW2 was now a loss-making endeavour due to most colonies having no industry or economy of their own. Indian Subcontinent was the primary example.
