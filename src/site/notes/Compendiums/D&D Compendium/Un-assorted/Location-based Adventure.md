# Location-based Adventure
> Anadventure or campaign in a [[Table-Top Role-Playing Game\|TTRPG]] which is based around a specific location on the map and people do not move about much.

Location-based Adventures could be keeping peace, rescue a captive, seize control of  a castle or defend a city against an invasion. 

Start with a location & the goals of the party, the adventures like these often involve attacking a particular [[Dungeon\|Dungeon]] to protect the location or just regualr Policing of the location which uncovers a smuggling business or crime syndicate. Location-based Adventures can expand into multiple locations if needed fairly easily.

Avoid the party staying in one city with not much happening for too long since adventures like these have a chance of getting boring quite often.
