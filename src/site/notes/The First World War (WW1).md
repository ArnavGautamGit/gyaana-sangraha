# The First World War (WW1)
> A War fought from 1914 to 1918 between the Colonisers in Europe using agrarian & industrial support with a good chunk of manpower from their colonies to supply their armies.

It was known as "The Great War" back then since nno other such worldwide war was known to have happened. I still need to learn more about it. I know more about WW2 than The Great War. The war is well known to introduce [[Trench Warfare\|Trench Warfare]] to many parts of the world which were not habitual to it. The tactics used in Trenches are given in the dedicated note.

### Causes of WW1
1. Germany crossed into the Balkans and invaded those regions
2. Assassination of the Austrian Prince
3. Vladimir Lenin blamed Imperialism & the American Socialogist [[William Edward B. Du Bois\|William Edward B. Du Bois]] said that the war was a "scramble for Africa" in a race of who could exploit Africa the most.
