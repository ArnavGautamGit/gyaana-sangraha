# Google Maps Digest
> Google Maps Digest is an opt-out feature in Google Maps where the Mapping service sends the user an email each week detailing the individual locations (along with Google Maps Coordinates) that the particular user has been to throughout the week.

Since I have found it out, I have personally opted out of this service but there is an obvious thing that Google Maps (despite not being allowed to access my location when the app is off) is able to know where I am even when I do not explicit navigate to the said location using Google Maps. This means my data was collected and stored without asking me first.

### Questions to Google
- How much data is collected from an individual user at a given time if they have opted for Google Maps Digest?
	- Why do they not provide a list of what data is collected from which opt-out and opt-in services on a website which is openly advertised or linked as a source in websites that are?
		- If the reason for not doing so is"avoiding panic" then it means they are collecting enough data to spook an average individual.
	- Do they collect more data in states with weaker or less detailed Cyber Secuirty and Privacy Laws than the [[European Union (EU)\|European Union (EU)]]? (for example)
- Can a government ask for the kind of data comprising of which users were around a particular location at a particular time? 
	- What data about individual users does exactly does Google share in such instances?
		- If they were to ask for ***all data*** for ***all users*** surrounding the location? Would Google comply?
	- What if some of these users present at said location are of higher profile or status than ordinary citizens? Would Google share their data too?
- How much time does Google take to respond to such requests? (estimate)
- Would Google share this data in case of India asking for data on Pakistani diplomats residing in their own High Commission or Embassy inside India? 
	- If yes, then can we conclude the following:
		- Google would share data of Indian Diplomats in the Indian High Commission in Pakistan too?
		- Google is ready to sell anyone's data to any government if it means their service keeps running and they can keep earning money.
