# Spotlight & GM Move
> Spotlight is a mechanic in [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/Daggerheart\|Daggerheart]] which dictates when either the players and the GM play their move during scenarios that may or may not be limited to combat.

The way spotlight works is that the GM can spend 1x [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/General/Fear Token\|Fear Token]] from their side to momentarily shift the spotlight to themselves and shift the narrative. If the GM does not wish to spend a Fear, they have to wait for an opportune time when the players are done with their turn or if the players roll with Fear or outright fail a roll. 

### GM Move
The move made by the GM or the way the world reacts/interacts with the players before the spotlight is handed back to the players is called a "GM Move". This is not present in other systems like [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/D&D Compendium/Dungeons & Dragons\|Dungeons & Dragons]] since the GM is not treated like a player (with extra responsiblities). 

The best time to make a GM Move (apart from when play returns to you naturally) is when either the players look up to the GM for what happens next, perform an action that would have some consequences or when the players give the GM a golden opportunity to jump in (without cutting anyone off) for a dramatic beat. 

A Simple Example of such a golden opportunity can be that the Player Characters (PCs) are hiding from a group of thieves while discussing the bandit leader’s plans, a PC might say with dramatic irony, “But surely they won’t look in the eaves of every barn in the district!” In response, you might describe the barn door noisily swinging open as a bandit steps inside, a lit torch in one hand and a sword in the other as they peer into the rafters where the characters are hiding.

### Player Moves lead to GM Moves
When the GM describes the scene and players make a move, the GM then describes how the scene changes - the scene changes depending upon the GM Move chosen by the GM. Often the GM move is either going to be a reactionary move to player's Roleplay (RP) or it will be a reaction to an Action Roll result.

An Easy Reference to follow in case the GM is confused with regards to how they should intervene depending upon the Action Roll Result:
1. ***On Critical Success or Success with Hope***: "Yes, and..." (you get what you want & gain a hope, you may clear 1x [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Stress Point\|Stress Point]] if Critical Success)
2. ***On Success with Failure:*** Yes, but… (You get what you want, but there’s a consequence, and the GM gains a Fear.)
3. ***On Failure with Hope:*** No, but… (Things don’t go as planned, but you gain a Hope.)
4. ***On Failure with Fear:*** No, and… (Things don’t go as planned and it gets worse. The GM gains a Fear.)

### Examples for Great GM Moves
Make Moves that either incorporate PC's backstory, moves that PCs may not see, showcase collateral damage (best for a missed attack from a PC) or things that can reflect the world being alive and reactive to the PCs like shifting the environment, [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/General/Spotlight & GM Move\|Spotlight & GM Move]] an Enemy to try and go for either trying to break an effect/condition or to try and capture something of great importance.
