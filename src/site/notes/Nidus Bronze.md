# Nidus Bronze - D&D Charater
A D&D character of mine who is a decorated Commander of the [[Ylfings\|Ylfings]]. 
He is a senior of [[Fenrir\|Fenrir]] and I do not care about any sad fucking back stories on this one.
He is awesome as it is. Basically the Old-Man Kratos equivalent (peronality wise) in [[The Wandering Realm (TWR)\|The Wandering Realm (TWR)]]. 

### Character Portrait

- Rage can be used as a bonus action with `!a rage`
	- Rage can be dropped using the command `!`
- Use Breadth Weapon as: `!init attack Breadth -t <Target>`
- Attacking with weapons and spells are given in [[Avrae Commands Sheet\|Avrae Commands Sheet]]
