# Non-Alligned Movement (NAM)
> A global movement started by the founding [[State (United Nations)\|UN Member States]] as a diplomatic coalition of states which wanted to avoid their direct or indirect inclusion into [[The U.S-Soviet Cold War\|The U.S-Soviet Cold War]]. 

The movement began in 1955 via the conference at Bandung, Indonesia.
The movement was formally established on 1st September 1961 by inviting the members of Bandung Conference to another conference in the city of Belgrade, [[Yugoslavia\|Yugoslavia]].

It is to be noted that the movement is often considered to be a failure since every member or founder state had one or more neighbours who did become a part of [[The U.S-Soviet Cold War\|The U.S-Soviet Cold War]] and eventually dragged the NAM state in an Arms Race or War.

### Founding Members
1. India (under then PM [[Jawaharlal Nehru\|Jawaharlal Nehru]])
2. Indonesia (under then President [[Sukarno\|Sukarno]])
3. Egypt (under then President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser Hussein\|Gamal Abdel Nasser Hussein]])
4. Ghana (under President [[Kwame Nkrumah\|Kwame Nkrumah]])
5. [[Yugoslavia\|Yugoslavia]] (under President [[Josip Broz Tito\|Josip Broz Tito]])

### Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence
Principles mentioned by Zhou Enlai & PM Nehru back in 1954 during a speech in Colombo, Sri Lanka:
1. Mutual Respect for another state's Territorial Integrity & Sovreignty
2. Mutual non-aggression
3. Mutual non-interference in domestic affairs.
4. Equality and mutual benefit.
5. Peaceful co-existence.

### Legacy
- The Members of this movement began being known as "Third World Countries" since these nations allied with neither "First World" (NATO) nor "Second World" (Warsaw Pact).
	- Although nowadays all developing countries are referred to as "Third World Countries" instead. For Example: Pakistan, Kazakhstan etc are also colloqially called "Third World" even though they were alligned.
- NAM is not formally dead as is the 2nd largest group of states with 120 members, second only to the [[United Nations (U.N)\|United Nations (U.N)]] itself.
- NAM seemed to be doomed to fail since it followed [[Idealism\|Idealism]], whereas their neighbours were being [[Realism\|realists]].
- NAM is largely considered as a harmless summit of no consequence where leaders come to clear their names using speeches and photo-ops after clearly violating the very [[Non-Alligned Movement (NAM)#Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence\|principles of coexistence]] which form the basis of the movement. Example: Azerbaijain involving itself in a war with Armenia despite being a member since 2011.
