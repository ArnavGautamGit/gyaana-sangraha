# Cleric (D&D)
> Clerics gather & draw strength from the Gods and channel it into the mortal world to create miracles. Some characters multiclass into Clerics by having such a great attachment to their homeland - it is divine.
> 
> Blessed by a deity, a pantheon, or another immortal entity, a Cleric can reach out to the divine magic of the Outer Planes-where gods dwell-and channel it to bolster people and battle foes. Because their power is a divine gift, Clerics typically associate themselves with temples dedicated to the deity or other immortal force that unlocked their magic.
> 
> Harnessing divine magic doesn't rely on specific training, yet Clerics might learn prayers and rites that help them draw on power from the Outer Planes. Not every member of a temple or shrine is a Cleric. Some priests are called to a simple life of temple service, carrying out their devotion through prayer and rituals, not through magic. Many mortals claim to speak for the gods, but few can marshal the power of those gods the way a Cleric can.
