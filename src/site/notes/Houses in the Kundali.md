# Houses in the Kundali
Any Kundali has 12 houses representing different aspects of human life.
There are 12 houses because they need to match the number of Rāshi Constellations.

In the North Indian (Diamond) Style Chart, the houses are fixed and the rashis move from house to house when the kundali is designed.
In the South Indian Style Chart, the Rashis are fixed in order, Houses move & hence Ascendant has to be marked.

Each House has a particular list of attributes it describes of the native whose chart we can see.

Rāshis being in a house (or Rāshis being the house in Southern Style) means that aspect of the native's life will be ruled by the Rashi Lord and affected by the [[Graha (ग्रह)\|Graha (ग्रह)]] inside the house and those Graha which aspect the house - in that order. If the Rashi Lord does not like the residing Graha, it is not a good sign and the residing Graha gives malefic results. To see which Graha are malefic and which are benefic for a particular Kundali, easy shortcut is to memorise for each [[Graha-Lagna Relationship\|Graha-Lagna Relationship]] where I have listed for individual Grahas - the houses where they are benefic and the houses where they are malefic in accordance with Lagna.
