# Mobile Device Forensics
> In the field of [[Digital Forensics\|Digital Forensics]], it is defined as the process of conducting a thorough & honest [[Digital Forensic Analysis\|Digital Forensic Analysis]] necessary for investigating any [[Cyber Crime\|Cyber Crime]] committed via, committed on or committed with the help of a Mobile Device or Phone.

Nowadays these are also used in combination with conducting [[GPS Forensics\|GPS Forensics]] of potential suspects by the help of services such as the [[Google Maps Digest\|Google Maps Digest]] to check if a particular person or set of people were at the scene of a crime.

### Importance & Role in Investigation
These investigations are helpful in Civil Cases of divorce or harrassment, Corporate Cases of insider threats, data leaks or Criminal Cases such as Theft, Assault along with planned Criminal events such as Assassination or [[Terrorism\|Terrorism]]. 
Mobile Forensics is also useful in cases where Time Stamped Activity can be instrumental for proving [[Human Negligence (Crime)\|Human Negligence]] (as example) the suspect was on their phone while driving.

### Forensic Tools Required
Tools such as [[Magnet AXIOM\|Magnet AXIOM]], [[Cellebrite (UFED)\|Cellebrite (UFED)]] or [[Oxygen Forensic Detective\|Oxygen Forensic Detective]] are used by Law Enforcement and Forensic teams for [[Logical Data Extraction\|Logical]] and [[Physical Data Extraction\|Physical Data Extraction]]. In these methods the Collection of Data is performed by scanning and copying the entire File System of the device along with any files that are contained inside it.

If the device has a locked or encrypted disk, then the option of Physical Data Extraction exists where the entire disk is copied bit-by-bit & reconstructed - which bypasses most encryptions.

### Sources of Forensic Evidence
[[Digital Evidences\|Digital Evidences]] required to make a case for or against a suspect may come from many sources in the phone, it may come from [[GPS Forensics\|GPS Forensics]], it may come from [[Email Forensics\|Email Forensics]], but mostly sources for Mobile Forensic Evidence are:
