# Analogue Photography: Film > Digital
Film Photography is a great hobby to follow.
It is the original way of taking photos before Digital Cameras became a thing.
Analogue/Film Photography in the Digital Era & beyond allows for a more active photography session.
In the most common film format - the 35mm film, there are 36 photos in a roll unlike the almost infinite space your phone has (1 picture is some 1 or 2 Megabytes... you can store 500-1000 photos before you get to 1 GB and phones have storage space of 128 GB).
Film makes you ask if the picture is worth the one spot among the 36 that you currently have.

# Equipment I own
I have my mom's old [[Minolta Riva 70 Zoom\|Minolta Riva 70 Zoom]] which she has kindly allowed me to use when I get batteries & film for it.
I am not sure if the flash works on the camera or not.
I am not even sure if the camera works at all!

# Equipment I need
FIrst off, I need the film! Second off, I need the batteries for my [[Minolta Riva 70 Zoom\|Minolta Riva 70 Zoom]].
It uses 123A battery cell.

#### Non-necessary Equipment
If I decide to develop my own film, I need the two development solutions (which come in bottles which have just enough quantity for 2 rolls) and I need a darkroom - on Amazon, there are many development tanks available which are smaller than most diaries in length and breadth whereas could kind of tall. Do keep in mind that I must put the film in the tank in a dark room.

# How to handle Film
Film must always be handled in the dark unless the canister is closed i.e., film to be developed is only handled in a dark room called as a "darkroom".
Most cameras have a rewinding button or lever which we have to turn (or press if button) to roll the film back into the cannister before opening camera's back.
