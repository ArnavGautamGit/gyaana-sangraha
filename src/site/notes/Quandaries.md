# Quandaries
> A situation where the decision-maker ish confused about which of the choices to make since both choices seem equally viable.

Quandaries can be of many types:
1. ***Ally-based***: There are 2 allies but neither of them can even stand each other let alone work together, the decision-making character(s) must choose one of the two.
2. ***Friend***: Mission or fulfilment of a friend's wish?
3. ***Honour***: Mission by breaking the oath/honour code or failing the mission and risking death.
4. ***Rescue***: Rescue the hostages or catch the villain?
5. ***Respect***: Two allies give conflicting intel, the one you decise to ignore takes it as a sign of distrust. Which do you choose?
