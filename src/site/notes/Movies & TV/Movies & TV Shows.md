# Movies & TV Shows
> A list or Catalogue of movies I own Physically or Digitally either as physical DVDs, Bluray Discs or even MP4s ripped from Bluray

I personally love Blurays more than other mediums but alas, it is not a widely adopted medium in India as new content goes straight to Streaming Services (often called OTT in India).

> [!tip] Important Note: I do not endorse Piracy but realise it is a [[Piracy is a viable Personal Choice\|personal choice]]

In the following table, DVDs that my dad bought for me during his business visit to China are labelled separately as "Chinese DVD" instead of just DVD. This is also because I suspect they might be some counterfeit/bootleg discs and not originals.
