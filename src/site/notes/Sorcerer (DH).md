# Sorcerer (DH)
> A [[DH Character Creation#Character Class\|Character Class]] of powerful beings who have natural attunement to magic (unlike [[Wizard (DH)\|Wizards]] who have to study magic) and can be dangerous foes to fight. 

Although they have a [[Dungeons & Dragons\|D&D]] equivalent as [[Sorcerer (D&D)\|Sorcerer (D&D)]], it is still to be noted that in D&D, sorcerers can use many of [[Wizard (D&D)\|Wizard (D&D)]] spells, it isn't the case here.

### Domains
Domains of a class decide the Domain Cards (and abilities) one gets to pick up.
Each Class has 2 fixed Domains.
The Sorcerer's domains are: [[Arcana\|Arcana]] and [[Midnight\|Midnight]].

### Base Scores
Base [[Evasion Score\|Evasion Score]]: 9
Major Damage Threshold: 6 
Severe Damage Threshold: 12

### Class Items
Each Class has a specific item they choose which will be a plot point in the story. They
must choose one of the options.
For a Sorcerer, choose EITHER *"Whispering Orb"* OR *"Family Heirloom"*

### Sorcerer's Hope - Special Ability
Spend 3x [[Hope Token\|Hope Token]] after Spellcast Roll to double the number on your Hope Dice.

### Class Features
***Arcane Sense*** can be used to sense the presence of magically-adept people & magical items when the Sorcerer is nearby them.

***Minor Illusion*** can be used on a successful spellcast roll against a difficulty of 10 to create a minor visual illusion no larger than yourself within Close range. The Illusion is convincing to anyone within Far Range.

***Channel Raw Power*** can be used once per long rest, where the sorcerer can place a Domain card from their Loadout into their Vault and choose to do one of the following:
- Gain Hope equal to Card Level
- Enhance a damage-dealing spell by dealing extra magic damage equal to twice the level of the card.

The Domain Card returns to the Sorcerer's loadout after a short rest.

### Class Foundations (Subclasses)
Spellcasting Trait for both subclasses is [[Instinct\|Instinct]].

- ***==Elemental Origin==*** lets you choose an element from which your character's powers emerged and lets you control them.
	- ***Foundation Feature***
		- Your elemental origin lets you manipulate and shape a certain kind of element.
		- Choose one: WATER · FIRE · AIR · LIGHTNING · EARTH
		- You can channel this element into unique, harmless effects. Additionally, you can spend a [[Hope Token\|Hope Token]] and describe how your control over this element helps an action roll you’re about to make, then add either +2 to the roll or +3 to the damage.
	- ***Specialisation Feature***
		- You can call forth your chosen element to protect you from harm. When an attack roll against you succeeds, you can spend a [[Stress Point\|Stress Point]] and describe how you channel your element to defend you, then add 1d6 to your [[Evasion Score\|Evasion Score]] against the attack. If the new Evasion Score is high enough to avoid the attack, it does.
	- ***Mastery Feature***
		- Once per long rest, you can transform into an elemental form of your chosen element. When you do, describe your transformation and gain two of the following benefits until you finish your next short rest:
			- +4 to your Severe Threshold
			- +1 to a character trait
			- +1 [[Proficiency Level\|Proficiency Level]]
			- +2 to your [[Armour Score\|Armour Score]]
			- +2 to [[Evasion Score\|Evasion Score]]
- ***==Primal Origin==*** lets you manipulate your magic.
	- ***Foundation Feature***
		- Your primal origin allows you to modify the essence of magic itself. When you cast a spell or use a weapon that deals magic damage, you can mark a [[Stress Point\|Stress Point]] to do one of the following:
			- Extend its reach by one range.
			- Add +2 to the action roll result.
			- Reroll any number of Damage Dice.
			- Hit an additional target within range.
	- ***Specialisation Feature***
		- You can enhance the magical practices of others with your essence. When you Help an Ally on a Spellcast Roll, the advantage die you roll is a d8 instead of a d6. After you help them make their Spellcast Roll, once per long rest, you can swap the values of their Duality dice.
	- ***Mastery Feature***
		- You can gather magical energy to enhance your capability. You become charged after taking magic damage or when you spend 2 Hope to become charged. When you successfully cast a spell while charged, you can spend your charge to temporarily increase either that spell’s Damage Proficiency by +1 or its Reaction Roll Difficulty by +3.
