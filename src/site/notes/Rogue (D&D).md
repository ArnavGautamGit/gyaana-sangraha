# Rogue (D&D)
> Relying on the intelligent trap placement and mastery of stealth to gain the upper hand against any opponent - even using some magic here and there. Many Rogues focus on stealth and deception, while others refine skills that help them in a dungeon environment, such as climbing, finding and disarming traps, and opening locks. 
> 
> In combat, Rogues prioritize subtle strikes over brute strength. They would rather make one precise strike than wear an opponent down with a barrage of blows. 
> 
> Some Rogues began their careers as criminals, while others used their cunning to fight crime. Whatever a Rogue's relation to the law no common criminal or officer of the law can match the subtle brilliance ofthe greatest Rogues
