# Fuzzing
> A [[Black-Box Testing\|Black-Box]], [[Dynamic Testing\|Dynamic Testing]] Process of entering Random Data to check how it affects the website or app we are examining. It is done to check the impact of a random case on the system and if it can handle it well.

This topic 99.999% (if not 100%) of the time better understood and explained by students who took "Fuzzy Sets and whatever" as their electives in 5th or 6th semester in JIIT (whenever that subject is freaking offered).

### Detailed Description of Types
A Proper Test using Fuzzing (also called Fuzz Testing) involves monkey inputs - all possible inputs even those that make no sense & seeing what the impact is on the system very similar to how a rat in a maze tries every single turn and prepares a map of the entire maze in its head as it tries to find the way out.

Fuzz testing can also be donw as a part of [[Static Testing\|Static Testing]] via Code Review.
Replacive Fuzzing replaces certain parts of the input/code with another part where the part replacing the original is called as a [[Fuzz Vector\|Fuzz Vector]].
