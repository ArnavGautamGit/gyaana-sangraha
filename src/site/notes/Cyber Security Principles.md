# Cyber Security Principles
> Systems & their Security need to have principles to define the mission in the easiest way possible & give a checklist to how to protect systems.

Any system is most vulnerable at its weakest point. Any robber trying to rob your house won't try to force his way in through a locked Door if an unattended open window gives easier access.

Using this analogy we can derive the Principles of Computer Security:

> ***==Principle of Easiest Penetration==:*** *"An Intruder must be expected to use any available means of penetration."* i.e., the attacker will not attack how you want them to, or follow the path you expect them to. Expect Attacks from anywhere and everywhere.

> ***==Principle of Adequate Protection==:*** *"Computer Assets must be protected only until they lose their value. They must be protected to a degree consistent with their value."*
> Example: OTPs don't need to be protected once the timer runs out.

> ***==Principle of Effectiveness==:*** *"Controls must be used - and used properly - to be effective. They must be efficient, easy to use, and appropriate."*

> ***==Principle of Weakest Link==:*** *"Security can be no stronger than its weakest link."* 

> ***==A Threat is blocked by control of a vulnerability==***
> ~ Charles P. Pfleeger, Shari Lawrence Pfleeger
> i.e., if we have a vulnerability but we control and protect with a good IDS (Intrusion Detection System) and a good Response System, the vulnerability can never turn into a threat or be exploited for an attack.
