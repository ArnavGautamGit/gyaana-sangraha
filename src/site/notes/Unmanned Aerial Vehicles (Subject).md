# Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (Subject)
> It was also the name of a subject in my 8th Semester (final semester) of my B.Tech Computer Science Engineering Degree at JIIT, Noida. 

The Subject is taught by Janadhan Sir who is notorious as a professor who doesn't give a flying fuck about when you walk into the class. His teaching skill sucks and his handwriting really resembles dead bugs on the Whiteboard. He is extremely lazy about sharing study resources and either shares slides one day before exam or doesn't share them at all.
