# Composed Arms
> Rarest Tradition in [[Marshalling of Arms\|Marshalling]] of [[Heraldic Achievement\|Arms]] is the creation of a new coat of arms which incorporates some of the charges from the parent arms instead of using them as is.  

Certain main charges are used to provide character and define a [[Heraldic Achievement\|Coat of Arms]], if we use such defining charges which can work and add them together to form a unique design, that would allow the family to skip [[Quartered Arms\|Quartering]] for one generation. Down the line this means simpler coat of arms with less quartering but still being able to represent the same number of ancestors.

In the old times in Europe, it was the tactic used to simplify [[Quartered Arms\|Quartered Arms]] whose quarters have quarters. Obviously it was quite rare to need it then.
