# D&D Monster Manual
> The Third of the [[Compendiums/D&D Compendium/Dungeons & Dragons\|D&D]] Corebooks which specifically helps [[Dungeon Master (DM)\|DMs]] to get inspiration for their adversies in D&D that their players may face. Some adversaries may be taken directly.

D&D Monster Manual is one of the last Corebooks any player or [[Dungeon Master (DM)\|Dungeon Master (DM)]] should read after reading [[Compendiums/D&D Compendium/Corebooks/D&D Player's Handbook\|D&D Player's Handbook]] and the [[Compendiums/D&D Compendium/Corebooks/D&D Dungeon Master's Guide\|D&D Dungeon Master's Guide]], players generally do not need to read it at all unless they want to optimise their characters & even then it should NOT have precedence over [[Compendiums/D&D Compendium/Corebooks/D&D Player's Handbook\|D&D Player's Handbook]] in reading order.
