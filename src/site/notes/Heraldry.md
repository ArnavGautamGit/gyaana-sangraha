# Heraldry
> Study of [[Heraldic Achievement\|Heraldic Achievements]] and [[Coat of Arms\|Coat of Arms]] of various surrounding lands and those that exist in lands of their own. The Study is now limited to Europe - where these Achievements were first seen.

Heralds were originally like [[Diplomacy\|diplomats]], envoys or messengers who world meet other kings and lords. To better survey and understand who they were dealing with, they began learning the meanings and depictions of their [[Heraldic Achievement\|Heraldic Achievements]] until it eventually became their job as Heralds reached expertise.

### Varying Traditions
Regardless of its origins, Heraldry was first practiced in Europe in the 12th century. It gained popularity in the 13th and 14th century. It came with its own laws as seen in [[Laws of Heraldry\|Laws of Heraldry]]. Even in Europe, the Laws have inconcistencies and some diversity depending upon the location since Heraldic Traditions saw changes as the practice moved from location to location. For Example: the [[English Heraldic Traditions\|English Heraldic Traditions]] completely differ from the [[French Heraldic Traditions\|French]] or [[Portuguese Heraldic Traditions\|Portuguese]] Traditions although certain core rules are the same.

### Heraldry in India
The practice of Heraldry in India has been inspired by many European Empires (French, British and Portuguese) who colonised parts of India during 18th to 20th Century since it helped the Europeans keep track of various kingdoms, they also brought their own customs. Many Laws were common and a wide majority of kingdoms in India followed either the [[English Heraldic Traditions\|English]] or the [[French Heraldic Traditions\|French Heraldic Traditions]].
