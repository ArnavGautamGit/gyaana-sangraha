# Debt-Trap Diplomacy
> A way of [[Diplomacy\|Diplomacy]] which leverages the ability of one state to showcase their economic [[Soft Power\|Soft Power]] by issuing large debts to another at terms which seem to be at a bargain but there are hidden terms attached. For Example: Seizure of the assets where loan money was spent.  

It is popularised by China which is infamous for using debts as a method to trap states into payment or seize assets. Popular case studies of its use include: 
[[Chinese Investment into Hambantota Port\|Chinese Investment into Hambantota Port]]
[[China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC)\|China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC)]]
[[China Myanmar Economic Corridor (CMEC)\|China Myanmar Economic Corridor (CMEC)]]

### Process
China also forces economically weak countries to sign its [[Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)\|Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)]] in exchange of money & financial assistance in construction of roads, highways, ports etc.
The Chinese Government officials show the victim state's government of how the project will lead to a turn around in the victim's economy and how the exacerbating interest rates are justified.
Soon, when the victim is unable to repay the loan and go into a worse economic crunch, China takes the developed asset on a 99 year lease as 'compensation' or 'collateral'.

### Nepalese Exception
Nepal have been replying befittingly to the Chinese. They are the only exception to the list of states which have signed the [[Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)\|Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)]] & have not been close to falling into a Debt-Trap.
None of the BRI projects have begun work or drawn funding since Nepal wishes to try multiple options in terms of funding which would be on the same terms as [[Asian Development Bank (ADB)\|Asian Development Bank (ADB)]] and the [[World Bank\|World Bank]] instead of loan lending & terms dictated by the Chinese Government.

### The Takeaway
 China has been able to provide USD $365 Billion dollars of Bilateral Loans which (due to being bilateral) go unreported in International Bodies & hence transparency is not possible.
 Besides expanding the debt trap, the BRI projects have faced accusations of corruption, environmental pollution, and labour violations across these countries.
