# Clarity is Power
> I have read about this concept in [[Meditations\|Meditations]] and have been told this thing by my own father quite a few times.

I will not quote the entirety of the Book3, Verse 11 but I will only mention my learnings from the reading along with anecdota evidence.

One must record the happenings and one's opinions on them and enjoy the power of critical thinking - by critiquing things and understanding what one said and did. This slowly build character and sharpens your wits - extra exposure to different things in life eventually starts building your own viewpoint, likes, dislikes, interests and one starts recognising their own passions & goals with what one wants in life.

This Clarity of what one wants to do & achieve in life effective wins half the war because all that is left is to plan and attack your goals & Nuke them. Frst we figure out what to attack and then we go into [[Independent Courses/Attack Mode/Attack Mode (Course)\|Attack Mode]].

> [!cite] Quote: *Meditations - Book 4 , Verse 2*
> "Let no action be done at random, nor otherwise than in complete accordance with principles involved"

Do not just do something because you can - always have a reason for why you are doing something and not something else. Do not start doing something because someone else told you that this is a good idea.

Marcus Aurelius believes that there is no better recluse for a person than their own soul i.e., one must introspect and write down their thoughts in the form of mini-essays.
