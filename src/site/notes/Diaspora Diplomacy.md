# Diaspora Diplomacy
> A way of exerting or extending [[Diplomacy\|Diplomatic]] [[Soft Power\|Soft Power]] to either convince another [[State (United Nations)\|State]] or affect their decision-making by leveraging their [[Diaspora\|Diaspora]] present in said State.

India often leverages their Diaspora to make other States make Pro-India policies. 
Same is the case with China.

Majority among the [[Diaspora\|Diaspora]] is often in agreement with their home state. Example: Jewish Americans like Ben Shapiro among others will always support Israel. When the states recognise this, they can leverage their Diaspora to make great strides in Diplomacy.

[[Diaspora\|Diaspora]] may be involved in conflict resolution or conflict escalation. Cypriots from both Greek Side and Turkish Side live peacefully in Green Lanes of London. Same can't be said for Hindus and Muslims of London.
