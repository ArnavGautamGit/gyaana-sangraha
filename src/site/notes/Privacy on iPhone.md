# Privacy on iPhone
> A note that builds upon [[Mobile Phone Privacy\|Mobile Phone Privacy]] using software specific instructions for [[iOS\|iOS]] devices like iPhones and iPads.

This guide assumes that you have read and religiously followed [[Personal Online Privacy\|Personal Online Privacy]] and [[Mobile Phone Privacy\|Mobile Phone Privacy]] as much as possible and want to look towards actionable software steps for your iPhone/iPad.

### How to protect your data
Keep Advanced Data Protections (ADP) always on over your account especially if you have used iCloud for storing anything (including iPhone backups) and if you have used or currently are using iCloud+.

Also, keep in mind and note where Lockdown Mode is. Keep that enabled on days when you are suspect you would need to hand over your phone to any officials for forensic checks (which are common on Border Crossings in USA) and need to protect your device against Nation-State level threats and tracking. If you are going through similar crossings and wish to continue to use FaceID, keep it off for iPhone Unlock in Settings > FaceID & Passcode (especially when going to places where your phone might be checked directly).

### Steps to Reduce Tracking
Firstly, recheck the tracking permissions via Settings > Privacy & Security > Tracking.
Preferrably remove all apps and make sure you have heavy reason to enable tracking for ANY app and even turn off the toggle at the top of this screen "Allow Apps to Request to Track".

Secondly go to Settings > Privacy & Security > Location Services.
Here disable the location for all apps that you don't think need it or at least click on their names and change their location permissions to "When I share" and turn off precise location for any app that is not a navigation app or needs navigation data (also get separate GPS or Navigation Device for your car like the good old days)

Thirdly, got to Settings > Privacy & Security > Apple Advertising.
Search for "Apple Advertising" in the search bar in Settings if the location has changed but turning this off will turn off apple's personalised ads.

Fourthly, go to Settings > Privacy & Security and scroll down to "Share iPhone & Watch Analytics" so that you can turn off the data shared to Apple. There are enough normies to share their data with Apple.

Fifthly, you can go to Settings and search for Safari. Here you can harden your settings for Safari by preventing [[Cross Site Scripting (XSS) Attack\|Cross-Site Scripting]] and other similar attacks.

Finally, although you must never use Apple Mail and put all your eggs in the same basket, please go to Settings, scroll down to see the option named "Apps" and then click on "Mail" before tapping Privacy Protection and turning on Protect Mail Activity if it is not on by default.


### Extra Tips for iPhone Users
- When signing up on new accounts using Safari as your web browser, choose the option to HideMyEmail regularly to fuck with advertisers. 
- Go to Settings and click on *{your name}* > iCloud > Private Relay > IP Address Location
	- Change the setting to "Use Country & Timezone" to make your location more obscure instead of the default which uses your exact IP Address
