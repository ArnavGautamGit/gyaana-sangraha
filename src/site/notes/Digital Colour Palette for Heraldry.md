# Digital Colour Palette for Heraldry
> Colour Pallete for designing a [[Heraldic Achievement\|Heraldic Achievement]] correctly so that each colour is vibrant and very distinct.

Digital Colour Palette is something that is extremely important for your emblazonments to look vibrant & powerful - as [[Heraldry\|Heraldry]] demands. I will evolve this with more colours & metals as I analyse more emblazonments by popular heraldry artists who like working with digital softwares to keep heraldry relevant in this digital age.

### Hex Codes for Tinctures & Stains
Gules/Red is best in `F60000` and `BD0000` (you may need two shades for shading charges)
Sanguine/Maroon looks the best in `860000` or `470000`

### Hex Codes for Metals
Or/Gold is best in `F9CA00` with `E1B700` for shadows & `FFD51F` for highlights.
Honourable mentions for Gold: `EBC31C`

Argent is simply `000000` with any gray shade for shadows.
