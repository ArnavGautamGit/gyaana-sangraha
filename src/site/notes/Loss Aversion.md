# Loss Aversion
> Tendency of avoiding a loss since emotionally, losses feel heavier than gains of equal value i.e., humans do not get as happy on gaining X compared to how sad they would be on losing X.

Popularly witnessed in (but not limited to) finance & monetary gains/losses. People in Stock Investing also tend to sit on loss making stocks since unrelaised loss is apparently not as bad as realised loss - prime example of [[Sunk-Cost Fallacy\|Sunk-Cost Fallacy]].

### Leveraging Tips
Tell people what they lose if they don't use your product. In an effort to avoid loss, people will buy your product. On the other ghand, people won't give a rat's ass about your product otherwise regardless of how many features it has. Prime Example being [[LG Wing\|LG Wing]] Phone.

### Avoidance
You can't avoid it. You have to realise it by self awareness (helpful via [[Soliloquies\|Soliloquies]] and any other [[Self-Awareness Techniques\|Self-Awareness Techniques]])
