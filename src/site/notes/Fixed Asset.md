# Fixed Asset
> A type of [[Asset\|Asset]] that cannot be easily [[Liquidation of Assets\|Liquidated]] (or sold for money) - it takes time to sell and find a buyer who would pay the quoted price for it immediately without much negotiation.

Fixed Assets cannot be sold on a whim to get money. This is due to dispersed demand.
Fixed Assets include assets like [[Land\|Land]] - which is extremely hard to sell for market price.
