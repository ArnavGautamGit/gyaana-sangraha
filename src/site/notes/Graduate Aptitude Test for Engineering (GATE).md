# Graduate Aptitude Test for Engineering (GATE)
> It is a test for Engineers seeking admission into Masters Degree programs in Engineering. Others can also apply but I didn't check for them much.

It has various versions based on the domain of Engineering you want a Master's Degree in.
Some Universities in Germany and Singapore also accept GATE Scores although there can be a linguistic or cultural gap when moving to another country.

## Benefits
