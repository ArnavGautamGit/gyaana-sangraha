# Flaming Lotus
> Flaming Lotus is a Homebrew Campaign Frame for Daggerheart which is planned by me to have its own set of Homebrew Weapons, Ancestries and Maps.

Flaming Lotus is set in Asia but not limited to the Indian Subcontinent and is supposed to go east all the way to Thailand & Combodia while on the west stretch beyond Afghanistan to as far as parts of Iran and Sumerkand. In North, it streches to Tibet and in the south, it goes till Maldives.

> [!tip] NOTE: Campaign Limits are for supplementary material only
> Campaigns as run by individual GMs may go and stretch beyond these boundaries but supplementary materials will only be given for the included regions withing the boundaries of the campaign frame.

## Homebrew Weapons
Weapons inspired by the Ancient Indian & Asian settings. It is important to know that weapons change based on Geography. So the geographical locations where the weapons are popular are also mentioned along side. 

In the table below, the weapon names are mentioned along with their hit dice, range, features (if any) also their community where these weapons are prevalent. Prevalence is a guideline, not a rule. 
Click on the weapon names (once image links are added) to see the images of individual weapons.
