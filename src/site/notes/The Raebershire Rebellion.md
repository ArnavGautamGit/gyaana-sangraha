# The Raebershire Rebellion
> Event in [[Storms of Eslance\|Storms of Eslance]] canon where [[House Raebershire\|House Raebershire]] treasoned against the ruling dispensation of the [[Kingdom of Dragonpeaks\|Kingdom of Dragonpeaks]].

The [[House Raebershire\|House Raebershire]] felt very neglected with the politics of the Day. They were a cousin house to the ruling [[House Forechester\|House Forechester]] but they were not given any much importance during and after [[The Wedding of Peace\|The Wedding of Peace]].

Many Raebershires say that it was the case earlier as well - they were sidelined and given the furthest-most region to the Capital but it was not that considered that big of a deal since they got [[Quakeport\|Quakeport]]! It was the city where every shipment had to go through it. They charged a hefty sum in taxes too! But the unification due to [[The Wedding of Peace\|The Wedding of Peace]] meant that they could not tax home internal shipments - reducing their revenue.

In one year, they planned a Rebellion, they staged an attack on Queen [[Ivara II Bronze\|Ivara II Bronze]] with the Drakona of [[House Azure\|House Azure]] who felt similarly neglected. The plan was to shoot her - while the Drakona House wanted the power for themselves, they planned to get her shot and throw the Raebershires under the bus.

Raebershires planned to kill the queen outright so that the power falls to the King who was their cousin & help them against colonising land in the west of the mountains... 
In the fight of who-throws-who under the bus, the arrows to be used were swapped with poison ones by henchmen on the payroll of [[House Raebershire\|House Raebershire]].

His Majesty [[John VI Forechester\|King John VI]] as the King of Dragonpeaks & Owlesia decided to withdraw any financial or military support promised to the Raebershires & also took away their statuses as Barons & Dukes. [[Sir Arthur I Nightingale\|Sir Arthur I Nightingale]] was honoured for his bravery & made the new Duke of Owlesia.
