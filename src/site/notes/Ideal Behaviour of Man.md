# Ideal Behaviour of Man
> [[Marcus Aurelius\|Marcus]] descirbes the ideal behaviour of a man across multiple verses of [[Meditations\|Meditations]].

> [!quote] *Meditations Book 3, Verse 5 (3:5)*
> "In action be neither grudging, nor selfish, nor ill-advised, nor constrained. Let not your thought be adorned with overmuch nicety. Be not a babbler (unproductive person who talks too much) or a busybody (overtly busy person who has no time to talk).
> Let the God within direct you as a manly being, as an elder, a statesman, a Roman, and a ruler, standing prepared like one who awaits the recall from life, in marching order; requiring neither an oath or testimony of any man. And withal, be cheerful, and independent of the assistance and the peace that comes from others; for it is a man's duty to stand upright, self-supporting, not supported."

Marcus wants to say that an ideal man must not hold grudges, must not be selfish, must not be ill-advised and must never be half-heartedly doing things or feel constrained by others. He prefers to be as nice as one needs to be - nothing more and nothing less.

One must not enjoy too much comfort but at the same time avoid over-working themselves. An Ideal man must not be dependent or concerned with what others think of him. He must be independent and be ready to help others if they seek help & the man can reasonably provide. One must have a spine and speak their opinions freely without needing the support of others (as in their arguments must be sound enough to not need support)
