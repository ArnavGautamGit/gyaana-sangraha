# D&D Multiclassing Rules
> Multiclassing is a process of adding a new class to your existsing classes. You can multiclass upon gaining any level at any time. Right from Level 1

As long as you clear the Pre-requisites you can multiclass into the other class but keep in mind multiclassing means taking the lower level abilities of a new class and forgoing the higher level abilities of existing class since total Character Level (sum of levels of each class) can only be 20.

### Prerequisites
To qualify for a new class, you must have a score of at least 13 in the primary ability of the new class and your current classes. For example, a Barbarian who decides to multiclass into the Druid class must have Strength and Wisdom scores of 13 or highex since Strength is the primary ability for Barbarians and Wisdom is the primary ability for Druids.

Since you can never know which class you may end up multiclassing into (most of the time) so you tend to keep the characters balanced and this is what is called [[D&D Character Optimisation\|Min-Maxing]]. It is an important skill to have.

### Character Levels & Hit Dice
Combined Character Level cannot exceed 20. A level 3 fighter with 3 levels in Barbarian willbe a Level 6 Character. Hit Points are determined by combined Hit Dice. You got 3 levels in Fighter and 3 levels in Barbarian? Take 3d10 and 3d12 dice. If two classes have same hitdice you can pool them together.

### AC, Features & Proficiency Bonus
Choose one of the two features if you get another one for calculating AC.
Choose one of the two copies if you get the same feature twice. For Example: if you gain the Extra Attack feature from more than one class, the features don't stack. You can't make more than two attacks with this feature unless you have a feature that says you can (such as the Fighter's Two Extra Attacks feature).
Your Proficiency Bonus is based on your total char acter level, not your level in a particular class, as shown in the Character Advancement table. For example, if you are a level 3 Fighter / level 2 Rogue, you have the Proficiency Bonus of a level 5 charac ter, which is +5.

### Spellcasting
Your capacity for spellcasting depends partly on your combined levels in all your spellcasting classes and partly on your individual levels in those classes. Once you have the Spellcasting feature from more than one class, use the rules below. If you multiclass but have the Spellcasting feature from only one class, follow the rules for that class. 
***Spells Prepared***: You determine what spells you can prepare for each class individually, as if you were a single-classed member of that class. If you are a level 4 Ranger / level 5 Sorcerer, for example, you can prepare five level 1 Ranger spells, and you can prepare six Sorcerer spells oflevel 1 or 2 (as well as four Sorcerer cantrips). Each spell you prepare is associated with one of your classes, and you use the spellcasting ability of that class when you cast the spell. 
***Cantrips***: If a cantrip of yours increases in power at higher levels, the increase is based on your total character level, not your level in a particular class, unless the spell says otherwise
