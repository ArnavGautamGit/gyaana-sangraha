# Wind Energy
> Harnessing Kinetic Energy present in moving wind to convert it into Mechanical Energy and possibly other forms of energy (mostly electrical). 

We have documented use of Wind Energy by Millers from at least 15th Century CE but converting the Mechanical Energy into Electrical Energy is a relatively new phenomenon in history.

Wind's Kinetic Energy was earlier converted to Mechanical Energy through the shaft and with the help of gears, it woul help mill the grain. Which is why a Wind Turbine was called "Windmill" back in the day. Milling grains with the help of wind. Milling was also done using Water wheels in [[Watermill\|Watermill]].

Now, if we connect the shaft to a gearbox which connects to a generator, we can generate Electricity! This power is called "Wind Power".
The entire subject is around how much power can be generated from a singular "Windmill" or "Wind Turbine".

### Wind Turbine Anatomy

### Wind Turbine Types
Wind Turbines come in two main types that are defined by the ***Axis Direction***. Each of the two Axis Directions require a different ***Rotor Type***.

The Axis Direction is basically the angle of the shaft with respect to the ground in the neutral position of the Wind Turbine. There are naturally 2 axis directions: Horizontal and Vertical.

Horizontal Axis Wind Turbines (HAWTs) require a Lift type rotor where the rotor spins on the Vertical (Lift) Force applied by flowing wind. It is the Lift provided by the wind which lifts the rotor and turns it. 

Vertical Axis Wind Turbine (VAWTs) require a Drag type rotor due to it being fed by the Drag Force of the wind. The wind is supposed to drag the rotor as it flows past to spin it.

| Comparison Domain | Horizontal Axis Wind Turbine (HAWTs)                                           | Vertical Axis Wind Turbine (VAWTs)                                                                  |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Efficiency        | ✔ More Efficient due higher wind speed at heights.                             | ❌ Less Efficient due to ground height and lower wind speeds at ground level.                        |
| Scalability       | ✔ More Scalable by just increasing tower height.                               | ❌ Less Scalable, everything needs to be scaled up together.                                         |
| Servicing         | ❌ Harder to service or maintain due to the Generator being up in the air.      | ✔ Generator being on the ground makes service & maintainance easier.                                |
| Reliability       | ❌ More moving parts due to an extra Yaw Mechanism - more things that can fail. | ✔ Does not need a Yaw Mechanism since the rotor is Drag type. More Reliable as less parts can fail. |
Which of the Wind Turbines we would want to use depends on the location where it is needed and the amount of wind we can expect.
