# Nuclear Fission Reactors
These Reactors are where fuel rods (made of the [[Fissile Material\|Fissile Material]] picked for use) and control rods are used in a environment with [[Radioactive Shielding\|Radioactive Shielding]] to conduct [[Nuclear Fission Reactions\|Nuclear Fission Reactions]] on 1-5 kilos of Nuclear Fuel at once with one starting neutron being absorbed...

The Energy released by the process of [[Nuclear Fission\|Nuclear Fission]] inside the reactors heats the walls of the water containers. The water (which is now in form of a steam) turns the turbines of the AC or DC generators to generate electricity.

The Electric Energy generated via such Reactors is a form of [[Nuclear Energy\|Nuclear Energy]].
