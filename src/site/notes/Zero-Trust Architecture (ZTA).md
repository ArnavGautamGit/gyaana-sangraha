# Zero-Trust Architecture (ZTA)
> [[Cyber Security (CyberSec)\|Cyber Security]] Architecture based on the principle of never trusting any user & always verifying their credidentials. It is made as a combination of multiple techniques

It can also be understood as a superset of the following technologies
[[Authentication\|Authentication]] (particularly [[Multi-Factor Authentication\|Multi-Factor Authentication]])
[[Authorisation\|Authorisation]]
[[Role-based Access Controls\|Role-based Access Controls]]

### Benefits
- Strong Protection against both [[Insider Attacks\|Insider Attacks]] and [[Outsider Attacks\|Outsider Attacks]].
- Limits [[Privilege Escalation\|Privilege Escalation]]
- Provides better visibility & control over users, devices & data.
- Helps in adopting [[Work-from-Home (WFH)\|Remote Work]] Culture

### Example
Recently around 9th August 2025, my Samsung phone started to throw tantrums, a glitchy screen would cause the phone to shut off completely, but it would be able to turn back on. Next day, the same error occured but the phone never recovered and went into a [[Blue Screen of Death\|Blue Screen of Death]] issue. 

Since I did not have access to a device marked as "trusted" in Google's Ecosystem and the prime way for Google to conduct [[Multi-Factor Authentication\|Multi-Factor Authentication]] is to send a prompt on my trusted device (like my phone) which needs me to click "Yes it is me" button on the phone's prompt. 

Try turning off your phone and login to Google from a new device or location & see the magic. It will feel like travelling to hell and back with how layered the security system on Google is. This is the best example of a Zero-Trust Architecture. You won't be trusted as the authentic user and be allowed to access your account just because you gave the correct credidentials.

On the other hand, Spotify accounts were fairly easy to hack since people just need your password (no [[Multi-Factor Authentication\|Multi-Factor Authentication]] is needed) and all that hackers need to do is guess your password once and they are in.
