# Bard (D&D)
> Poets, Musicians or Dancers - sometimes all three - Bards are the ultimate Hype-People in the party. Bards are expert at inspiring others, soothing hurts, disheartening foes, and creat ing illusions. 
> 
> Bardic magic attempts to harness those words, which transcend any language. 
> Anything can inspire a new song or tale, so Bards are fascinated by almost everything. 
> They become masters of many things, including performing music, working magic, and making jests. A Bard's life is spent traveling, gathering lore, tell ing stories, and living on the gratitude of audiences, much like any other entertainer. But a Bard's depth of knowledge and mastery of magic sets them apart.
