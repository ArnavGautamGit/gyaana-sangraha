# Guardian (DH)
> A [[Compendiums/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/DH Character Creation#Character Class\|Character Class]] of powerful infantry soldiers or mercenaries who can change the tide of the battle. Some of their features may look similar to some other classes in other [[Table-Top Role-Playing Game\|TTRPGs]] but they are unique to [[Compendiums/Daggerheart Compendium/Daggerheart\|Daggerheart]].

Guardian love to be on the front-line and absorb damage.
Melee is their forte but they may hit from afar - generally they still do not like someone else other than a [[Compendiums/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Classes/Warrior (DH)\|Warrior (DH)]] or fellow [[Compendiums/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Classes/Guardian (DH)\|Guardian (DH)]] being in the frontlines of battle for various reasons - the biggest one being that they won't be able to absorb as much damage & Guardians cannot heal.

Prioritise [[Strength\|Strength]] and [[Agility\|Agility]] for a Brutal Guardian or [[Finesse\|Finesse]] can be added in the list to make a skilled Guardian from a noble Rapier-wielding background.

### Domains
Domains of a class decide the Domain Cards (and abilities) one gets to pick up.
Each Class has 2 fixed Domains.
The Guardian's domains are: [[Valor\|Valor]] and [[Blade\|Blade]].

### Base Scores
Base [[Compendiums/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Evasion Score\|Evasion Score]]: 9
Base [[Compendiums/Daggerheart Compendium/General/Hit Point Slots\|Hit Point Slots]]: 7

### Class Items
Each Class has a specific item they choose which will be a plot point in the story. They must choose one of the options.
For a Guardian, choose EITHER *"A Totem From Your Mentor"* OR *"A Secret Key"*

### Guardian's Hope - Special Ability
***Frontline Tank***: Guardian can spend 3x [[Hope Token\|Hope Token]] to clear 2x [[Compendiums/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Armour Slots\|Armour Slots]].


### Class Feature - Unstoppable
Once per Long Rest, the Guardian can choose to become unstoppable and gain an extra dice (starting at d4 on level 1). Count the number of turns on your Unstoppable dice where you deal damage of 1 or more [[Compendiums/Daggerheart Compendium/General/Hit Point Slots\|Hit Point Slots]]. When the count exceeds the largest number on your dice, you drop the Unstoppable Feature and remove the dice.

While Unstoppable, you gain the following:
- Reduced Effect of Physical Damage by one Damage Threshold. 
- Add the current value of the Unstoppable Dice to damage rolls.
- Immunity to being [[Restrained\|Restrained]] or [[Vulnerable\|Vulnerable]].


### Class Foundations (Subclasses)
There are two subclasses of Guardian suited to two major styles of play.
Stalwart allows you to tank attacks while Vengeance allows you to deal higher damage.
Personal recommendation is to take Vengeance since you can already regain [[Compendiums/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Armour Slots\|Armour Slots]] and tank more using [[Compendiums/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Classes/Guardian (DH)#Guardian's Hope - Special Ability\|Guardian's Hope]] discussed above.
- ***==Stalwart==*** allows players to be a frontline tank unit who takes and sucks up all the damage that the enemies do.
	- ***Foundation Feature***
		- ***Unwavering***: Increase both Damage Thresholds by +1 permanently.
		- ***Iron Will***: Can mark an additional [[Compendiums/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Armour Slots\|Armour Slots]] to reduce damage.
	- ***Specialisation Feature***
		- ***Unrelenting***: Increase both Damage Thresholds by +2 permanently.
		- ***Partner-in-Arms***: When an ally in Very Close Range takes damage, you can reduce it by expending a maximum of 1 [[Compendiums/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Armour Slots\|Armour Slots]] of your own. Your [[Compendiums/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Armour Score\|Armour Score]] will be used.
	- ***Mastery Feature***
		- ***Undaunted***: Increase both Damage Thresholds by +3
		- ***Loyal Protector***: When an ally within Close range has 2 Hit Points or fewer and should take damage, you can immediately mark a Stress to sprint to their side and take the damage instead.
- ***==Vengeance==*** allows the player to play the frontline damage dealer who absolutely deletes any enemy standing before them.
	- ***Foundation Features***
		- ***At Ease***: Gain an additional [[Compendiums/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Stress Point\|Stress Point]].
		- ***Revenge***: When an enemy hits you in Melee range, mark 2x [[Compendiums/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Stress Point\|Stress Point]] to deal 1x [[Compendiums/Daggerheart Compendium/General/Hit Point Slots\|HP Slot]] of damage back at them.
	- ***Specialisation Feature***
		- ***Act of Reprisal***: When an enemy damages an ally in melee range of you, you gain a +1 [[Compendiums/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Proficiency\|Proficiency]] for the next successful attack against that specific enemy.
	- ***Mastery Feature***
		- ***Nemesis***: Spend 2x [[Hope Token\|Hope Token]] to prioritize ONE enemy until your next rest. When you make an Attack Roll against your prioritized enemy, you can switch the values on your Hope and Fear dice.

### Background Questions
These help the players think about their character deeper or get a few points of thought to nudge them in the direction to aid character building. Choosing to answer these questions are completely optional:
- Who from your community did you fail to protect, and why do you still think of them? 
- You’ve been tasked with protecting something important and delivering it somewhere dangerous. What is it, and where does it need to go?
- You consider an aspect of yourself to be a weakness. What is it, and how has it affected you?

### Connections
These help you in case your party wants to have a premade set of connections between the party i.e, if you want the party to know each other before the campaign begins. Choosing to answer these questions is completely optional:
- How did I save your life the first time we met?
- What small gift did you give me that you notice I always carry with me?
- What lie have you told me about yourself that I absolutely believe?
