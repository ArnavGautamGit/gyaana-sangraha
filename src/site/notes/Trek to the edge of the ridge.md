# Trek to the edge of the ridge
The trek involved taking the path right next to the FRH. The path began from the parking and went right through the front of the house of an old gentleman. The path can be followed to reach a small Temple shrine dedicated to Shiva at the edge with the view of [[महासु देवता मन्दिर, बिसोई\|महासु देवता मन्दिर, बिसोई]] and other towns nearby. Far in the distance, we also saw the snow-covered Himalayas.

Reconstruction of the trek route using Google Earth Pro on Ubuntu:

Reconstructed View from the edge (reconstructed using Google Earth)
The mountain peaks on the left and Bandarpunch mountains whereas the two on the right are Gangotri Mountains & Kedarnath - which also explains why there is the Shiva Temple Shrine here.

We did take some real images...
I will attach them as I find them. It takes time to move them from Phone to PC and I am too lazy for that. Plus, reconstructions are not weather-dependent and can sometimes yield better results.
