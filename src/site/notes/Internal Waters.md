# Internal Waters
> The Water Area contained within the [[Coastal Baseline\|Coastal Baseline]] of any [[State (United Nations)\|Member State]]. It includes Lakes, Internal Lakes, Rivers etc. It is also to be noted that unless the Member State is Archipelagic or has their own particular laws, the State has jurisdiction to even disallow any [[Innocent Passage\|Innocent Passage]] as well.

The following text is taken from the note on [[Coastal Baseline\|Coastal Baseline]].

<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><a class="markdown-embed-link" href="/coastal-baseline/#8c6ff5" aria-label="Open link"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon lucide-link"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a><div class="markdown-embed">



In case of an Archipalegic [[State (United Nations)\|Member State]], the islands that fall within the Jurisdiction of the State can be connected by Straight Baselines. The same rules apply in the case of Baselines across a [[River Delta\|River Delta]] or the mouth of a [[Bay\|Bay]]. 

</div></div>


Using the point quoted above, any land which is within these Straight Baselines are also considered Internal Waters of any Archipelagic [[State (United Nations)\|Member State]] but since geographically these areas are effectively Straits & paths between islands, they have to allow [[Innocent Passage\|Innocent Passage]] to avoid an area of the seas becoming completely sealed off and avoid creating a loophole one State or group of States can use to isolate another.

Using this ruling in favour of Straight Baselines, India & Bangladesh have both taken Straight Baselines across the Sundarban Delta. India has also claimed Chillaka Lake in Odisha as Internal Waters using this rule.
