# Morarji Desai's Blunders
If you want to know who was Morarji Desai, please refer to another note: [[Morarji Desai\|Morarji Desai]]
This note only deals with the blunders of Morarji Desai in his short tenure.
### ==Blunder 1==: Declining US offer to help in the Indian Nuclear Program in 1977
Then US President Jimmy Carter offered India heavy water ([[Morarji Desai's Blunders#^1\|#^1]]) and [[Uranium\|Uranium]] for our Nuclear Reactors in 1977 in exchange of seeing our stock of Nuclear [[Fissile Material\|Fissile Material]]. 

### ==Blunder 2==: Revealing to Pakistan we know about Pakistani Nuclear Program in 1978
It was Morarji Desai who flauntingly told the Pakistani General [[Zia ul-Haq\|Zia ul-Haq]] about India having the knowledge of the Pakistani Nuclear Project meaning he indirectly told the Pakistani General of India having infiltrated [[Project 706\|Project 706]].
What followed was the witch hunt & extermination of each and every R&AW asset that existed in Pakistan. Not to mention Desai had also reduced R&AW funding by 30% or so.

# Footnotes
1. ***Deuterium Oxide ($D_2O$)*** - Deuterium is a hydrogen isotope with 1 proton and 1 neutron in the nucleus opposed to just 1 proton. Since Deuterium's atomic weight is heavier than regular water, it means any amount of $D_2O$ would be heavier than the equivalent amount of $H_2O$. So, sometimes it is called "Heavy Water"
