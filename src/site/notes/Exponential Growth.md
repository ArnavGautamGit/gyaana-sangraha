# Exponential Growth
> Defined as growth in the order of $\Large n^a$ which refers to $\Large n$ multiplied with itself to a total of $\Large a$ times. 

Due to [[Evolutionary Biology\|Evolutionary Biology]], Human Minds understand [[Linear Growth\|Linear Growth]] much more easier. So to convert Exponential Growth to Linear Growth, it is easily done by Logarithmic Formulas (known as the Rule of 70).
$$\Large T \approx \dfrac{70}{r}$$
Where $\Large T$ is the time in which the initial number will double 
and $\Large r$ is the exponential rate of growth.

***Example***: If traffic increases by 7% per year, it will double every 10 years (since 70 divided by 7 is 10).
