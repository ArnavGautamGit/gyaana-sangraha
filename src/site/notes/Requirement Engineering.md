# Requirement Engineering
> The Process of Ellicitation, Specification (including Documentation) and Analysis of the requirements provided by the client during the process of assigning a [[Software Development Project\|Project]] to the Developers. It is the first step in the process of [[Project Scheduling\|Project Scheduling]].

For simplicity, we are going to keep the Requirement Analysis a part of this note for brevity's sake and the fake that Ashish sir used the terms "Requirement Engineering" and "Requirement Analysis" quite interchangably.
### Process of Requirement Engineering:
- ***[[Requirement Ellicitation\|Requirement Ellicitation]]***
- ***==Requirement Gathering==***: List of requirements after being translated to technical language and a list of features need to be coded to fulfill these requirements.
- ***==Feasibility Study==***: Rough idea presented by the client is analysed for something tht can be realistically and legally built or not.  
- ***[[Software Requirement Specification (SRS)\|Software Requirement Specification (SRS)]]***: A Document in which the System Analysts document all the requirements in a technical language, along with the feasibility, legality, estimated budget & estimated timeline.
- ***[[Software Requirement Validation (SRV)\|Software Requirement Validation (SRV)]]***: Requirements and the SRS are validated to check if anything is illegal, if the solution is impractical or the experts have interpreted the requirements inaccurately.
## What all should the SRS document contain?
- Client Requirements as expressed in natural language
- Technical Requirements as expressed in Structured Language.
- Design description should be in pseudo code.
- Format of forms and Graphical User Interface (GUI) screenshots.
- Mathematical Notations wherever used.
## Types of Requirements with the analogy of a phone:
1. ***System Rerquirements***: Phone's operational constrainst written in structured and technical language. Contract between client and contractor.
2. ***User Requirements***: Natural Language and Diagrams are used to market the phone.
3. ***Functional Requirements***: Features of the phone, Camera quality, Screen Refresh Rate.
4. ***Non-functional Requirements***: Colour of the phone or its durability.
