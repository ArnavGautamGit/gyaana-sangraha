# Payload Design
> A design principle in Aerospace & Aeronautics involving designing a system which is capable of performing an efficient carriage & possible delivery of given [[Payload\|Payload]] having defined dimension and weight limits to a specific location.

Design process needs to keep in mind the role that the Aircraft needs to play and also know the specific [[Payload#Classification of Payload\|Types of Payloads]] the aircraft will end up carrying.
Example: If we are going to be carrying a cargo payload on a [[Fixed-Wing UAVs\|Fixed-Wing UAV]] we must look at creating an Internal Bay which has to open to drop/unload cargo.
