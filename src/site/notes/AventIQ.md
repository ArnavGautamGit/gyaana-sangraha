# AventIQ
> Previously also called "Mittal Software Labs" or MSL, it is the first company where I worked from office (WFO) 5 days-a-week in my life as a Software Engineer. I have had internship experience before working here but those were primarily work-from-home (WFH) or Hybrid modes.
 
AventIQ is a small company where they work as a Software Consultancy firm helping businesses get their digital solutions made and designed. They even often handhold their clients through the transition on training their employees how to use the solutions and also work on maintaining delivered projects. 

I worked on a similar production-grade environment on a project (named CPT/CPA) that had been delivered to Cooper Standard and was getting new updates and bug fixes fairly regularly.

## Culture
While on the job I had made a few pointers on how I finded the company. This was first made during the day of my onboarding since my onboarding was delayed due to technical glitches. I later used to add to this list each Sunday when I would review my week's work.

- Work Culture is relaxed
	- no one micro manages about if you are doing work
		- they care about whether the work is done before deadline or not.
	- the management is almost dream-like except their pay.
		- the pay is not amazing - especially for interns.
		- if you miss even more than 6 days, you are paid half month salary.
	- there is something called "FunDo Friday" or "Fun Friday" at the last friday each month.
		- Everyone gets free Pizza from Dominos - regular size, Cheese & Corn (regardless of position)
	- Although no one stops you from going early in unpaid phase
		- as a paid employee/intern you are expected to leave at 7pm.
		- there is also an expectation to come to ofice at 9:30am by the latest but that is not followed & arriving late wasn't punished during my stay either.
		- Most people arrived to work at 10. I was one of the few that arrived at 9.
- Employee Culture
	- People may pick calls in the day
	- People go to the balcony near the entrance to talk or call.
	- People also go to the balcony area to relax for a bit or take a break.
		- Sometimes people go out of the building to nearby *tapri* or roadside kiosks.
	- Awards and other such things are also celebrated in said area.
		- Awards generally include an Amazon giftcard beteen 4000 to 10k balance.
- Hiring and Firing
	- people will suddenly get fired or asked to resign.
	- the process is often silent & hidden from employees.
		- It is said the process is based on "employee performance".
		- Performance is judged by team lead & sent to HR via mail.
	- People are fired or hired on an almost monthly basis
		- First window is 1st Month Completion.
		- Next window is 2nd Month Completion and so on.
		- If you last 6 months, you are absorbed.

## Lessons I Learnt
The company had quite competitive culture which was borderline stressful due to the competitiveness while the work environment was not that hectic.

But I learnt a few things from this experience: 
1. I should not "take my time" to settle anywhere and should always be proactive.
	1. Learn new tech stacks and focus on working
2. Do not skip asking questions because it may offend people in authority. 
	1. You are not seen as obedient or nice.
	2. You are seen as timid, reclusive and a person with no love of learning
	3. You may also be seen as a person who does NOT enjoy work.
3. Do not burn your bridges. It is always better to show up and tell them in the meeting that you would be unable to work that way & would like to leave. Leave on good terms by wishing everyone well - this is also something I did.
4. I should have stayed in better contact with people who left, sent LinkedIn requests left, right and centre.
