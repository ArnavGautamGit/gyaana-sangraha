# About the Campaign & Setting
The Campaign is set on the world of Lurov, whose map is currently being designed on Wonderdraft. It is a world where Seraphs are rare and majority races include [[Drakona (DH)\|Drakona (DH)]], [[Human (DH)\|Human (DH)]], [[Elf (DH)\|Elf (DH)]], [[Dwarf (DH)\|Dwarf (DH)]], [[Halfling (DH)\|Halfling (DH)]] with some forests having exotic & exclusive access of specific ancestries such as [[Galapa (DH)\|Galapa (DH)]], [[Fungril (DH)\|Fungril (DH)]] and [[Simiah (DH)\|Simiah (DH)]] in the same forest. Whearas seaborne-dominated islands see all of the above and the [[Ribbet (DH)\|Ribbet (DH)]].

Note that all other ancestries are not as common and may be rarer depending upon where we look. For Example, you may not see [[Clank (DH)\|Clank (DH)]] NPCs outside major rich settlements where people could AFFORD to build and conduct research on Automaton Technology & Technological Advancement in general.

# Magic System of the Setting
#### Dagger Key Doors
Special Doors in the Dragonpeaks that were created by [[House Raebershire\|House Raebershire]].
Appearing as an unorganised pile of wood planks which take the shape of a door when a person with the key comes closer to it. Almost all Kingdoms except Orcs use this system now but each major empire uses a different dagger design as key.

Imagine this as the doors utilised in the God Of War (2018) and Ragnarok games except instead of a rock, they use a dagger.

There are some fixed ones that are labelled and can only be taken to one spot. The colapsable ones can be used to travel anywhere the specific kingdom allows.
