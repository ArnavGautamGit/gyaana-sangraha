# Cryptocurrency
> [[Cryptography\|Cryptographically]] [[Cryptographic Encryption Algorithms\|Encrypted]] [[Decentralised Network\|Decentralised]] Tokens built on [[Blockchain\|Blockchain]] technology that can be exchanged similar to [[Fiat Money\|Fiat Currency]]. Unlike Fiat, it is not guaranteed value by any centralised government and purely dependent upon Supply & Demand & extremely volatile since it is traded like a stock on Global Cryptocurrency Exchanges all day 24x7 unlike conventional [[Stock Market\|Stock Market]] which only opens for a few hours per day.

All Encryptions in Cryptocurrencies are [[Asymmetric Key Encryption\|Asymmetric Key Encryption]] where the wallet has a Public Key to receive crypto and a Private Key to authenticate who the crypto is being sent by. Your Private Keys are different for each Cryptocurrency (different one for [[Bitcoin (BTC)\|Bitcoin (BTC)]] and different one for [[Ethereum (ETH)\|Ethereum (ETH)]] etc.) but all these Private Keys are derived from a 12 to 24 word Seed Phrase - which if you misplace, you will unable to access your wallet from a different device.

### Purchase & Storage Tips
First things first, your Cryptocurrency is identified by Keys like [[Pointers\|Pointers]] in memory point to a memory block. If you do not own the keys or have access to them, please keep in mind that when the custodian to those keys goes down, your Crypto goes with them. Which is why it is important to be your own custodian & own your keys! Exchanges own the keys and even among wallets, go for non-custodial wallets where you are the sole custodian of your keys.

> [!tip] TIP: Custodian vs Non-Custodian Wallets
> The term "Custodian" means that someone else (generally the company behind the wallet or exchange) holds the keys for you and in case that company goes bankrupt or runs away with your money (like FDX in 2022) you can say goodbye to all your crypto since that will be inside that wallet whose contents are inaccessible to you.

Other option is to store it in Cold Storage in a HDD or SSD.
It requires an immense amount of research and setup. Moreover, if you somehow set it up but forgot your password used to access that Cold Storage, you can say goodbye to the Crypto stored in there - it is the equivalent to a Safe at home. Always keep your Crypto locked behind a password which is written down.

### Personal Usage
I started my journey in Crypto in 2020 or so with Brave Browser (so that I can watch YouTube completely ad-free) which introduced my to Crypto via Brave Rewards. 
So I have an account on Crypto Exchanges (which is all I knew and all that Brave served) like Uphold and Gemini along with Indian ones like Vauld and WazirX. 
I now withdraw BAT into Bitcoin in Uphold and then transfer it over to my non-custodian [[Lightning Network (LN)\|LN]] wallet - Phoenix.
