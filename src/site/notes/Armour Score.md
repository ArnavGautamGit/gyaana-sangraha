# Armour Score
> A number on the [[Daggerheart\|Daggerheart]] Character Sheet of any character which states the total number of [[Armour Slots\|Armour Slots]] that the character has.

Naturally any Feature which adds +$\large n$ to Armour Score means that the characters gain an extra $\large n$ number of [[Armour Slots\|Armour Slots]]. (Doesn't matter where the Feature is coming from)

***Homebrew Rule on my table***: Armour Score is *NEVER* changed when striking off [[Armour Slots\|Armour Slots]] for record-keeping purposes & to maintain a fluid speed of the game by not making the players having to stop for a long time to edit the sheet. The players can just strike off a slot and be done with it.
