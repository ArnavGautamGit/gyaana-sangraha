# Peruvian Diagrams
There are diagrams found in the Peru mountains which have no reason or explanation to be there and when the Spanish asked the natives, they said that neither them or their ancestors know the reason it is there.

The only possible reason was found by the YouTube Channel named "Boho Sapiens".
The explanation found in the verses of [[Rāmāyaṇa\|Rāmāyaṇa]] suggest that these are the diagrams drawn by Indra to help the Vānara soldiers locate directions.
