# Researching a new Solar Panel Material
For the wings, I am also researching a material that can be used to in-build the Solar Panels into the wings - the material itself being conducive to Photovoltaic effect & creation of Solar Energy. Can I use the [[Ramanujan Universe (RU)\|RU]] to simulate something like this?

I need a material which can be used in creating wings for my [[Military Drones\|Military Drones]] idea which will allow for the creation and harvestation of Solar Energy without using external solar panels mounted on top of the wings which can fall or get destroyed/damaged. External panels also add to the weight of the aircraft.

## Material Criteria:
1. Band Gap comparable to Si or CdTe
2. Preferably direct-band gap - allowing Thin Film applications.
3. Robust enough to be CNC machined.
4. lightweight

More research needed.
