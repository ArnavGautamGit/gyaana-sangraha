# Microliths
> Geometrically shaped stone tools and implements built by [[Mesolithic Period\|Mesolithic]] proto-humans to efficiently perform tasks which require precise motor engagement that is not possible from bare fingers.

Microliths were most often used to cut smaller animals like mice and worms to use as bait for larger animals - most often large fish. Although they were also put to use for sewing leaves or other material together to produce thin proto-tents.

Hence, Microliths were the first pieces of *FINE* engineering i.e., engineering something on small scale. 

### Excavation Site in India
In India, first/earliest Microliths were found in an excavation site inside the present-day district of Begor, Uttar Pradesh (not to be confused with Beghor in Rajasthan which is a key excavation site of [[Neolithic Period\|Neolithic Period]]) It is believed that the proto-human settlement there must be fishing in the river Ganga or other Himalayan tributaries.
