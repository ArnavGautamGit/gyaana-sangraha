# Mauryan Empire
> The kingdom established by [[Vishnugupta Chanakya\|Vishnugupta Chanakya]] with his disciple [[Chandragupta Maurya\|Chandragupta Maurya]] as the new king to replace [[Dhana Nanda\|Dhana Nanda]] and the [[Nanda Empire\|Nanda Empire]] due to Chanakya seeing them as a failed dynasty.

Mauryan empire was based on [[Kautilya Arthashāstra\|Kautilya Arthashāstra]], [[Saptānga Theory\|Saptānga Theory]] and [[Mandala Theory\|Mandala Theory]] which were all written by Chanakya himself based on [[Vedic Literature\|Vedic Literature]], his own knowledge of economics, polity and statecraft as the professor of Economics at [[Takshila University\|Takshila University]].

### Formation
As we read in the note: [[Dhana Nanda#Speedrunning his own decline\|Dhana Nanda speedrunning his own decline]]
Chanakya was already not happy about the state of affairs under the Nanda rule and the final nail in the coffin was the way [[Dhana Nanda\|Dhana Nanda]] insulted him after leaving the oldest university of the subcontinent to the mercy of an invader ([[Alexander The Great\|Alexander III of Macedonia]]).

### Major Emperors
[[Chandragupta Maurya\|Chandragupta Maurya]] (321 BC to 297 BC)
[[Bindusāra Maurya\|Bindusāra Maurya]] (297 BC to 273 BC)
[[Ashoka\|Ashoka]] (268 BC to 232 BC)
[[Later Mauryan Emperors\|Later Mauryan Emperors]] (231 BC to 185 BC) spanning 6 kings

### Administration
Chanakya's works in the [[Saptānga Theory\|Saptānga Theory]] were mostly used to govern the internal administration sourced from [[Epigraphy\|Epigraphical]] records cross-verified by [[Literary Records\|Literary Sources]] like the [[Kautilya Arthashāstra\|Kautilya Arthashāstra]].

Chanakya advised to divide the land into 4 major provinces - each with a provincial centre headed by a Kumāra (Prince/Noble) and no prince could become an emperor without serving on at least one centre. [[Ashoka\|Ashoka]] had served as the Kumāra (Prince) of Takshila & Ujjain before he became the Emperor.

Mauryan Empire had the four centres as:
1. Tosali (Eastern India)
2. Ujjain (Central & Western India) 
3. Takshila (North-Western India)
4. Swarna-giri (Southern India)

Each Province was subdivided into Districts called Pradesha, Pradesta or Rajjukas with each district further divided into individual villages referred to as Gopa or Sthanika.

### Conquests
[[Chandragupta Maurya\|Chandragupta Maurya]] had famously defeated the [[Selucid Empire\|Selucid Empire]] of [[Selucus I Nicator\|Selucus I Nicator]] multiple times to regain his lands in north-west India & particularly to re-establish control over his Guru's [[Takshila University\|Takshila University]]. He also maintained cordial relations with Selucus to avoid making prolonged enemies & gifted him 500 elephants. In return, Selecus sent [[Megasthenes\|Megasthenes]] as an envoy to Chandragupta's court where [[Indica\|Indica]] was written. All of this is documented over Megasthenes's Indica and [[The Treaty of The Indus (303 BC)\|The Treaty of The Indus (303 BC)]].

[[Bindusāra Maurya\|Bindusāra Maurya]] is famous for conquering lands in central & southern India but did not go beyond Shravanbelagova - since he had served his purpose.

[[Ashoka\|Ashoka]] had conquered Kalinga by force but had conquered Asia culturally via the spread of [[Bauddha Philosophy (Buddhism)\|Buddhism]], its culture & its philosophy.

### Cultural Contributions
1. Development & Mainstreaming of [[Brāhmi Script\|Brāhmi Script]] for written Sanskrit
2. [[Ashokan Edicts\|Ashokan Edicts]] erected during Ashoka's reign after the 9th Regnal Year
3. Spread of [[Bauddha Philosophy (Buddhism)\|Buddhism]] via creation of [[Stūpa\|Stūpas]] and sending missionaries to other Asian Empires.
4. The Mauryans put "India" on the world stage and solidified the definition of the size of India which is still known as the "Indian Subcontinent" or sometimes "South Asia" when Pakistanis need Burnol.

### Decline & Post-Mauryan Age
[[Later Mauryan Emperors\|Later Mauryan Emperors]] after the death of [[Ashoka\|Ashoka]] were too weak & soft, they could not lead as well. Due to none of the Mauryan Emperors being followers of [[Hinduism\|Hinduism]], it weakened their connect with the people - particularly the Brahmins. Eventually [[Pushyamitra Shunga\|Pushyamitra Shunga]] who was a Brahmin by caste decided to publically assassinate the last Mauryan Emperor named "Brihadratha" in 185 BC and takes the throne for himself to find the [[Shunga Dynasty\|Shunga Dynasty]] controlling the Northern Gangetic Plains and the Central Indian regions upto the shores of river Narmada to the south of which (including regions like the Andhras and Karnataka) were controlled by local fragmented tribal rulers which we don't know much about due to no [[Archaeological Evidence\|Archaeological]] or [[Literary Records\|Literary Records]] of the time known as the "Dark Age of Central India" until the [[Sātavāhana Empire\|Sātavāhana Empire]] rose a century later.

The Kalinga region declared independence as the [[Maha-Megahavana Dynasty\|Maha-Megahavana Dynasty]] and the regions of North-west India (modern Pakistan & Afghanistan) which were influenced by the influx of [[Hellenistic Art\|Hellenistic Art]] & dominated by [[Indo-Greeks\|Indo-Greeks]] became Independent under the royal family of [[Yavana Confederacy\|Yavana Confederacy]].
