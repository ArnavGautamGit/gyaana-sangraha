# Overlevelling
> It is a weapon mechanic in [[Compendiums/Warframe Compendium/Warframe\|Warframe]] that allows weapons to level over the certain limit.

Each weapon in Warframe is limited to reach "Max Rank" at rank 30. However, weapons that feature Overlevelling can gain +2 rank for each time they are [[Polarised\|Polarised]] using a [[Forma\|Forma]]. One can only use a maximum of 5 Forma on a weapon (unless specified otherwise)

Total Levels after Overlevelling means $\large5\times2=10$ extra levels i.e., a new maximum of weapons can be increased by 10 Levels meaning extra points for [[Mastery Rank\|Mastery Rank]] Progression.
