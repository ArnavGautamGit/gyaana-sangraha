# Headwind
> The Phenomenon where the wind direction is opposite to a flying aircraft's direction, i.e., it is hitting the head or nose of the aircraft first.

For Flight, no or light wind is considered the best and Headwind is considered second best. Some pilots may land cleaner if there is some headwind - since it gives the pilot a good amount of feedback
