# Types of Cyber Attacks
> There are enough Cyber Attacks that they can be classified. Classification helps in dealing with & protecting against each type becomes easier for the [[White-Hat Hackers\|White-Hat Hackers]].

The categories on the basis of which the classification is performed (along with the types under each classification criteria) is given below:

## Based on Attacking Method
1. [[Disclosure Attack\|Disclosure Attack]] - A Circumstance or event where an entity gains access to hidden data. Also called ==Exposure, Intrusion== etc.
2. [[Masquerading Attack\|Deception Attack]] - Faking Identity, or Identity Theft. Unauthorised user is faking to be authorised one. Also called Masquerading, Repudiation and Fabrication.
3. [[Disruption Attack\|Disruption Attack]] - Affects Availability and system integrity by over-flowing  the system with data at more speed and/or volume that it can handle. Also called as Incapacitation and Corruption attacks. Pominent example being [[DOS Attack\|DOS Attack]].
4. [[Usurpation Attack\|Usurpation Attack]] - Illegal Seizure (taking control) of the system by illegal means by an unauthorised person. Also called ==Misappropriation== and ==Compromisation==

## Based on Attack Activity 
There are two kinds: Active Attacks and Passive Attacks.
- ***==Active Attacks==*** try to ***gain control*** or directly harm the system. This is the reason they are ***detectable***.
- ***==Passive Attacks==*** are generally/ideally **invisible**; i.e., ***programmed to be undetectable*** and ***stealthy***. Example: Keyloggers

## Based on Identity of Attacker
***==Insider Attacks==*** ---> an attack performed by someone inside the organisation which is controlling & protecting the system. i.e., Hacked by some traitor.
***==Outsider Attacks==*** ---> an attack performed by someone outside the organisation which is controlling & protecting the system. i.e. Hacked by some outsider.
