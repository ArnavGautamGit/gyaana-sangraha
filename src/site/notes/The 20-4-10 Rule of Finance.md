# The 20-4-10 Rule of Finance
This rule is used in Finance to (generally, but not limited to) buying cars. It is generally a rule for a big purchase which is expensive enough that you would require a short-term loan but not a house (since Home Loans have longer maturity such as 10 to 20 years. Plus, rental income can cover some EMIs from it)

It states that 20% of the full price of the commodity (here, vehicle) must bein form of liquid cash with the buyer.
The loan period must be 4 years i.e., 48 months (maximum of 5 years)
The EMI for the loan must not exceed 10% of the buyer's monthly income. (Income is measured monthy here since EMIs are monthly installments)

For a person with a 50,000 salary, you should not buy any vehicle/car which is more expensive than 2,40,800 (given interest is 9%).

At the same rate of interest (i.e., 9%) a person with a 70,000 monthly salary can buy any vahicle/major short-term purchase of 3,37,200 or less
