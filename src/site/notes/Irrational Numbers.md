# Irrational Numbers
> Numbers that cannot be represented as a [[Rational Numbers\|Rational Number]] Fraction.

Popular Examples of Irrational Numbers include: 
1. square root numbers of [[Whole Numbers\|Whole Numbers]] that are not [[Perfect Square Numbers\|Perfect Squares]] such as $\sqrt 2$, $\sqrt3$ etc.
2. Numbers like $\large \pi$ that are non-terminating and non-repeating decimals were included in Irrational Numbers since they cannot be represented as a fraction and don't fit the definition of Rational Numbers. The fraction representation of Pi as $\large\pi \approx \frac{22}{7}$ is an approximation of first few decimal digits.
