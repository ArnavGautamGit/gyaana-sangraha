# Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT)
> Any intelligence gained from open sources - sources which are not connected to your organisation or objective and are neither working at the behest of the target to shake off any Intelligence Officers.

Open Sources also include media, newspapers, public government data, academic publications from a university and other stuff including Twitter Handles that specifically operate as "Open Source XYZ" or "OSINT ABC" like names cn sometimes show information. A lot of it.

It is hard to verify this information if the open source is TOO open i.e., a YouTube Video or a podcast of someone since that is vulnerable to [[Story Bias\|Story Bias]] or [[Books Library/The Art of Thinking Clearly#Biases and Fallacies that can affect Decisions\|Other Biases]].
