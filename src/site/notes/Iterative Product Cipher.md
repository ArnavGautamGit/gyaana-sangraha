# Iterative Product Cipher
> If the process of Substitution and Transposition in any of the [[Product Ciphers\|Product Ciphers]] is repeated in a deteministic pattern it is called as an [[Iterative Product Cipher\|Iterative Product Cipher]].

As discussed in [[Modern Cryptographic Ciphers\|Modern Cryptographic Ciphers]], the "n" number of times the Substitution and Transposition are repeated is determined mathematically and may change between Encryption Algorithms.

There are two kinds of Iterative Product Ciphers: [[Substitution-Permutation Network\|Substitution-Permutation Network]] and [[Feistel Network\|Feistel Network]]. The popular encryption algorithm of the late 70s and 80s i.e., The [[DES (Data Encryption Standard)\|DES (Data Encryption Standard)]] is considered as the combination of both these networks.
