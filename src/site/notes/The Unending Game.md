# What is the book about?
The book is basically the account of an ex-R&AW chief about how the organisation functions where he offers insights into the types pf missions officers may have and about the "tradecraft" of spies. I am reading this to gauge if I should join the Intelligence Bureau or not. This book (to me) is going to serve as an input to how espionage actualy works in hopes of gauging if I am right for the Bureau and if the Bureau is the right choice for me.
