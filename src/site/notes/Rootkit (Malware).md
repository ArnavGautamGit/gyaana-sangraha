# Rootkit (Malware)
It is defined as:
> A Computer Program which tries to attain or ascend the root-user privileges so that it can hide itself from the user(s) of the machine. Well-made Rootkits may try to reestablish themselves if discovered and removed.

It is called a "rootkit" since it is a malware *kit* aiming to get *root*-user privileges. Example: [[Sony XCP\|Sony XCP]]

### How does it stay hidden?
Whenever you will execute a command that will list the processes or files then the rootkit would interfere, delete its name from the list and show the list to you.

### How to reveal & destroy it?
***Rootkit Revealer***: A program which displays files, then examines the disk and file system directly. Compares to two results to check if you have a rootkit installed on your PC.
