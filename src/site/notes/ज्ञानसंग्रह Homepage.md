# Welcome to ज्ञानसंग्रह !!

ज्ञानसंग्रह is a Sanskrit name formed by the concatenation of two Sanskrit Words: 
1. ज्ञान (Knowledge or Wisdom) 
2. संग्रह (Repository)

Putting them together you can easily understand that this is a Knowledge Repository which I use for learning in public and simultaneously backing up my notes via GitHub.

Since this is a repositiory similar to Wikipedia, you are free to press Ctrl+K (or Command+K for Mac Users) to open the Search bar & search for a specific item or note or scroll down and click a bright link (dim ones are not uploaded due to being incomplete).

If you are here to hire me? Please look at [[My Résumé\|My Résumé]].
Else, please keep reading.

# Intro to the संग्रह (Repository)
Each note using the new format is made without a creation date & updation date on it - so they are timeless. It does *NOT* mean that they are not updated when my thoughts & opinions about the topic changes. Each note starts with a quotebox which explains either what the note is about or defines the topic of the note.

Here is list of my interests & hobbies regardless of if that interest has an academic basis in my life & upbringing:

For my Academic Writings specifically, please refer to [[Academics\|Academics]] or specific subjects like my notes in [[Computer Science (CompSci)\|Computer Science]]. The Academics note refers you most subjects which I have studied Academically as a part of my formal education.
