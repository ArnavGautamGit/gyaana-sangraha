# Monk (D&D)
> Fascinated by Bruce Lee? Try the Monk! It is a D&D-fied Shaolin Monk.
> Where Rigourous Training meets Mental Discipline to do the unthinkable and fight any villain with bare or *almost* bare fists.
> Monks focus their internal power to create ex traordinary, even supernatural, effects. They chan nel uncanny speed and strength into their attacks, with or without the use of weapons. In a Monk's hands, even the most basic weapons can become so phisticated implements of combat mastery.
