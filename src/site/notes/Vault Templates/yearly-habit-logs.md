# {{title}}
> Detailed yearly view template derived from Shwetabh Gangwar's [[Independent Courses/Attack Mode/Attack Mode (Course)\|Attack Mode (Course)]] where a smaller course called "Nuclear Mode" was included. 

The Template details the Monthly and Daily Views of the Year of 202X.
The template can be customised and uses a Community Plugin named "Dataview".
Please see [[yearly-logs/2025/Year of 2025\|Year of 2025]] to see how to use this template properly. New tutorials shall not be mentioned here unless I replace the Dataview Tables with Obisidian Bases or something else.
