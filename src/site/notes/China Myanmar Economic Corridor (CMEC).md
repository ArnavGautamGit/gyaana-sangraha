# China Myanmar Economic Corridor (CMEC)
> Economic Corridor being built in Myanmar by China & Chinese Investors after Myanmar signed China's [[Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)\|Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)]] which they leverage for [[Debt-Trap Diplomacy\|Debt-Trap Diplomacy]]

The CMEC contains 15 MoUs and 33 Projects that were signed in the year of 2020 after Myanmar officially signed the [[Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)\|Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)]] in 2017.

CMEC also includes connectivity to older mega projects such as a deep sea port & industrial park for USD $10 Billion agreed upon in 2015, before BRI was officially signed. As of 2020, before the newer projects began to be implemented it was estimated that 40% of this initial loan of $10 Billion is owed to the Chinese. It is said that this number may have risen past that after [[Myanmar's Military Coup\|Myanmar's Military Coup]] and the prison sentence for [[Ong Sang Suki\|Ong Sang Suki]]

### My Views
It is in China's plans to begin encircling India by creating a presence in Arabian Sea using [[China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC)\|CPEC]] while leveraging the [[China Myanmar Economic Corridor (CMEC)\|CMEC]] for creating a presence in the Bay of Bengal.
