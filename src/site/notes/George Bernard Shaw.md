# Who is G.B. Shaw?
George Bernard Shaw was born in Dublin, Ireland in 1856. He grew up to be poor and lacked any professional training due to his dislike of it.
When he moved to london in his 20s, he became a music and theater critic. Later in life, he joined the Fabian Society (Socialist Group).
He was bored of the Sentimental Theatre which was at its peak at the time and rather was interested in writing plays which make his audience think and discuss. He wanted his audience to see the "reality" (Communism) 
# His Political Views
In this attempt to make his audience think, discuss, debate and discern what is the best ending, he avoided having clear endings in his plays. A lot of the times, the plays were designed in a way that only one of the possible endings were good. The others were just plain bad or ill-fitting to the characters. 
In short, his plays were a subtle ploy for every reader/viewer to agree with his ending. 
Why is that important? Because his plays were connected with Marxist Thought after he read and started to agree with Karl Marx's "Das Kapitel" and hence were obviously a way to show the people how communist thought is theoretically correct and progressive. A show of "soft power" of Communism, Marzism and related ideas. 
# Influence of Communist Ideology in his texts
In [[Pygmalion - Romance in Five Acts\|Pygmalion - Romance in Five Acts]] (and its Musical Adaptation - "My Fair Lady" starring Audrey Hepburn among others), we always see how Professor Higgins - a professor of Phonetics wants to remove the division of class which is visible in the way the "upper" and "lower" classes speak. He believes that everyone should have equal class. Throughout the story, Professor Higgins tries to empower and "make a dutchess" out of a road-side florist - very similar to the idea of Communism empowering the workers. Although to think of something like this in 1913 was astounding.
# Contributions to Literature
- ***Shavian Drama***: The term is inspired from his surname concatenated with -ian to define a politically and socially committed drama which are also called "discussion" plays popularised by him among some others
# Where he drew Inspiration from
[[Henrik Ibsen\|Henrik Ibsen]], another playright who lived from 1828 to 1906. He loved exposing the middle-class & their hypocrisy through literature. Saw art as an instrument of moral propaganda.
