# Network Scanning
> A Process of identifying Active Hosts on a Network for [[Social Engineering\|Social Engineering]] or [[Phishing\|Phishing]] Attacks.

It is a continuation of: [[DNS-based Footprinting\|DNS-based Footprinting]]

Here we scan for which services are active on the network, what the network topography looks like etc. The Hacker ([[White-Hat Hackers\|ethical]] or [[Black-Hat Hackers\|otherwise]]) tries to generate a map of the network to see what they are dealing with. Figure out where the weaknesses in the design are among other things to plan the attack.

Networks can be scanned by using various methods and tools but the most common of them all is via the use of [[TraceRoute\|TraceRoute]]. There is another tool known as "MTR" which also has some functionality taken from [[Ping\|Ping]].
