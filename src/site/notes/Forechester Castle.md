# Forechester Castle
> It is the Fortified Castle City built and ruled by [[House Forechester\|House Forechester]] in my homebrew setting serving as the capital of the [[Kingdom of Dragonpeak\|Kingdom of Dragonpeak]].

Originally called "Forechester Castle City", the name was too long until was shortened to the current name. Prior to this Castle being built, the [[Dragonpeak Citadel\|Dragonpeak Citadel]] functioned as the Capital and [[Eslance\|Eslance]] was a city where all the Dragonborn lived, the Forechesters decided to build a new Fortified City with Humans in it and when they eventually became the rulers, they officially changed the capital city to this new Castle citing "convenience".
