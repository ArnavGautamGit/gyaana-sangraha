# Round Key Generator Algorithms
> An Algorithm which allows the on-demand generation of one or multiple [[Substitution-Permutation Network#^1\|Round Keys]] used in [[Iterative Product Cipher\|Iterative Product Cipher]] from the main Cipher [[Cryptographic Key\|Cryptographic Key]].

Extensively used in Symmetric Encryption Algorithms which use an aspect of the Iterative Product Ciphers such as [[DES (Data Encryption Standard)\|DES (Data Encryption Standard)]].
