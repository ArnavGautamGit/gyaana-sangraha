# North Americans and their massive Carbon Footprint per-Capita
There are three main reasons why North America produces that much Carbon Footprint
1. High Consumption of Electricity in the Winter
2. Winter Electricity-demand surge is fulfilled with energy generated via burning of Fossil Fuels.
3. Over-dependability on cars

Let's look at each of the points in detail.
## High Consumption of Electricity in the Winter
The main reason for this is Centralised heating in homes. The centralised heating system produces energy for each room, the maximum one can do is either a) turn it off or b) keep the system on but close the heating vents in rooms not in use.

For whatever reasons people in North America do not like wearing Sweaters and jackets indoors. I have seen people stay indoors, blasting the centralised heating and drinking chilled drinks inside in nothing but their regular T-shirts and Pyjamas...

I do not have any problem with the American Culture but the thing is - 90% of the time they do not use all the rooms at once.
In areas of the Himalayas, there are houses which in their Ground Floor (American First Floor) keep their domesticated animals - such as Yaks, Horses among other animals, whose body heat (as it rises upwards) heats the home!

I see how Americans not having Yaks at home can be a barrier to entry but the fact that they do not use specialised heating (where Family uses a heater to heat a particular room) and everyone receding to the heated rooms is not practiced!
Its as if the culture of saving money is never taught to them?

Infact, there was no need to save the electricity if it was coming from a renewable source like a [[Windmill\|Windmill]] or [[Solar Power Plant\|Solar Power Plant]] or even [[Nuclear Fission Reactors\|Nuclear Fission Reactors]] but the problem is that this energy is not coming from a renewable source.

## Winter Electricity demand is fulfilled using Fossil Fuels
It is no secret that Fossil Fuels are used as a quick and cheap way to produce electricity and just like the fashion world, here it is true as well that "you get what you pay for" in the sense that the ease of producing energy in cheap prices means that the country/group of countries will have to invest the same amount of money if not more in managing the carbon footprint and pollution.

## Over-dependance on Cars
Cars are a mode of personal transport & India as a whole is turning to SUVs while we build more and more light rails in more and more cities in the country.
In the case of USA and Canada - and in general North America - it seems that SUVs, Pickup Trucks and other such vehicles are getting larger and more expensive as the countries turn more obese than before.

People are quick to dismiss light rail and public transport as a "socialist" or "communist" idea and point out how it is all BS. Not to mention how they have zero concern for cyclists and bicycle lanes.

Reality is that the exhaust gasses released by constant movement of cars create a hotspot in cities - i.e., temperature rises by a few degrees in the thick of cities compared to the suburbs and the outskirts/countryside.

Although Electric is better - but that is true on if the electricity is coming from a renewable source - not to mention how Lithium mining in itself contributes to Pollution and increase in global Carbon Footprint.
