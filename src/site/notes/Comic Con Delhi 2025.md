# Comic Con Delhi 2025
> An Annual Convention of Comic Book Geeks held in Delhi's NSIC Grounds. It is organised by an organisation called "Comic Con India" which is in the Indian Subsidiary of the Global Organisation which started this convention. 

The Closest Metro Station to Comic Con Delhi is Okhla NSIC (on Magenta Line) or Govind Puri (on Violet Line). 

I can do one of three things
1. Normal Visit: Nothing Special, just go as a regular person (Consumer Mindset)
2. Cosplay Visit: Dress up as your favourite Character (Creator Mindset)
3. Set up shop: Sell stuff I have created or designed for profit (Business Mindset)

### Normal Visit
Prerequisite: None
Things to bring: Wallet (with Metro Card) and Friends (at least one, if any).
What we get: Tote bag with 2 comics and some supplies or two.

### Cosplay Visit
Prerequisite: 3D Printer
Things to bring: Same as [[Comic Con Delhi 2025#Normal Visit\|Normal Visit]] + Costume
What we get: [[Comic Con Delhi 2025#Normal Visit\|Normal Visit]] + Tags on Instagram

### Set up Shop
Prerequisite: 3D Printer (if selling figs), Art (or other creations)
Things to bring: Same as [[Comic Con Delhi 2025#Normal Visit\|Normal Visit]] + Creations for sale
What we get: [[Comic Con Delhi 2025#Normal Visit\|Normal Visit]] + Money (hopefully more than we invested)
I will just leave a note here for in case I want to do any [[Creations for Comic Con\|Creations for Comic Con]]
