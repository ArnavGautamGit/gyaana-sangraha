# Ichi-go, Ichi-e (Japanese Concept)
> A Japanese Concept which is translated as "one time one meeting" reminding the others that each ecounter and each moment is unique - use it to the fullest.

The authors of [[Ikigai - The Japanese Secret to a Long and Happy Life\|Ikigai - The Japanese Secret to a Long and Happy Life]] claim that it describes a cultural concept of valuing each meeting with any person - from stranger to frinds and from friends to family - which is partly why the culture is so formal and polite.

### The Need / Reasoning
The concept is used as a reminder to cherish every feeling and behave politely with everyone because you never know when & how they may help you - but if you ruin the first meeting, you may have just ruined everything (if the damage is big enough).

### Implementation
- Try to be nice to people.
- Keep your chin up with happy music.
- Read more books (gives dopamine and keeps you happy)
- Also for more natural dopamine, if the nature around you allows, go outside and enjoy the nature - even if it is a concrete jungle with car and carbrains, it is better than locking yourself inside.

### Origins
It is said to have origins in [[Japanese Buddhism\|Japanese Buddhism]] and was first mentioned in the 16th Century as the proverb "一期に一度" (*ichigo ni ichido*) which translates to "once in a lifetime".
