# React Native: JavaScript Library made by Facebook!
> React Native is able to build Cross-platform Apps by building apps using native components from the specific OS that the client is using the app on. That is also a reason why tags like `<Safe Area View>` and other tags seldom produce different results on Android and iOS.

For Styling & Layout, see: [[React Native Styling & Layout\|React Native Styling & Layout]]

The best thing about React Native, is that it allows the use of [[Expo\|Expo]] and the *ExpoGo* App to simulate apps developed directly on my phone. 

Certain Companies also seem to use [[Xcode\|Xcode]] & [[Android Studio Simulator\|Android Studio Simulator]] to simulate the app on the PC/Laptop.

The Components in React Native are given in [[React Native Components\|React Native Components]]
