# Who was Dr. Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar?
Chairman of the Drafting Committee which discussed and ammended the Constitution's draft written by [[B.N Rao\|B.N Rao]] - forming the Indian Constitution. He Opposed Caste-based reservations (but did not prevent them) and later turned Buddhist after a press conference on 14th October 1956 when he announced the same.

He agreed to the idea of Pakistan but never did anything about making sure all the Muslims leave - contradicting his idea of "Hindus and Muslims cannot co-exist" since if he truly believed it then why not take action?

# Ambedkar's Political Views & Career
> Disclaimer: I am not afraid to break some eggs (offend some people) in my quest to find or shed light on the truth. 

For 25 years of his public life (ever since Gandhi became the de-facto leader of India's independence Movement in 1924 - after the unfortunate death of Lokmanya Tilak ji in 1920) overlapped with the Indian Independence Movement - which was to free India from the British Rule - Ambedkar "ji" did not ONCE participate in such revolts and movements. He wasn't there in Champaran, he wasn't there for Khilafat Movement (actually, I wouldn't be *there* for the Khalifa either) and nor was the future "Chairman of the Drafting Committee" ever a part of the satyagraha against the Rowlatt Act and the satyagraha against the Jallianwala Bagh Massacre.

While Indians fought for Independence Ambedkar became a membor of the Viceroy's Council - in simpler words, British Indian Cabinet MP.

The Government of Maharashtra has published 14 volumes of the speeches and writings of Ambedkar - comprising of 9,996 pages in total. In these 14 volumes, Vol. I to Vol. XII contain 7,371 pages and talk about Ambedkar's life until 1946. Just a year (if not months) before India achieved Independence.
I am yet to find a SINGLE letter, speech or passage in these 12 volumes where Ambedkar ever even indirectly implied to argue in favour of India's Independence i.e., until the year of 1946, Ambedkar was against the notion of India gaining Independence from the British.

To further prove this, I will produce a letter written by Ambedkar & published by the Mharashtra State Government in "*Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar, Writings and Speeches, Vol. X*" (page 492-499):

> "Allow me to say that the British have a moral responsibility towards the Scheduled Castes. They may have moral responsibilities towards all minorities. But it can never transcend the responsibility which rests on them in respect of the Untouchables. It is a pity how few Britishers are aware of it and how fewer are prepared to discharge it. 
> ***British Rule in India owes its very existence to the help rendered by the Untouchables***. Many Britishers think that India was conquered by the Clives, Hastings, Cootes and so on. Nothing can be a greater mistake. 
> ***India was conquered by an army of Indians and the Indians who formed the army were all Untouchables. British Rule in India would have been impossible if the Untouchables had not helped the British to conquer India.*** 
> Take the Battle of Plassey which laid the beginning of the British Rule or the Battle of Kirkee which completed the conquest of India. In both these fateful battles the soldiers who fought for the British were all Untouchables....."
{ #593da8}


This letter was written on May 14, 1946 to a member of the British Cabinet Mission, A.V. Alexander. A letter where he systematically proved himself that he wishes and fights for the social, financial and literary equality of a group of people (Harijans/Untouchables) who (in his own words) were the biggest traitors to the Indian Soil.

In the 1937 Brtish Indian Election, there were a total of 1583 seats of which 808 were General seats and 777 were reserved for people from chamber of commerce, plantations, law, labour etc.
Of the 808 seats, Congress alone won 456 seats. Congress won all Harijan-dominated seats in Bihar and Tamil Nadu - even when none of the stalwarts like Patel and Gandhi could even dream to speak even in cities like Chennai (then known as *'Madras'*) due to the language barrier of not knowing Tamil & English not being as popular as it is today. 

Congress then resigned in 1939 (2 years later) since the Brits were not willing to tell them when & how India will get Independence after the WW2. (Another one of Gandhi's theatrics, I assume)

Jinnah and Ambedkar celebrated this as "Deliverance Day" - The Golden Boy of Indian Nationalism and the "Dalit Role Model" was in cahoots with the people who in 1937 (i.e., 2 years prior) had coined the name "Pakistan" for the new nation they'll carve out of partitioning the country. Ambedkar was hand-in-hand with people who partitioned the country just because he was angry and frustrated for having no standing in Indian Politics and he believed that "Hindus and Muslims cannot live together" - the thought may be true but then why not make the nature of the constitution as Hindu-Buddhist? Why did he not think about the situation of what would happen when most of the countries in the India's periphery are Muslim Nations? Why not include all minority religions from Afghanistan, Pakistan (and others) getting citizenship in India since the beginning? I know why... the reason is that legislations like these require a vision of how you want the nation & the world to look like - Ambedkar's vision started and ended at "caste" and could never think beyond it. Indian [[State (United Nations)\|State]] when feeling cornered by Bangladesh turning Pro-Pakistan had to haphazardly bring in the [[Citizenship Ammendment Act (CAA)\|CAA]] but foolishly put a capped end date on it.

He wrote a book in 1945 named, **"What Congress and Gandhi Have Done to the Untouchables"**. In this copium of a book, Ambedkar "ji" tried very hard to win General Caste Hindu votes when he mentions over and over that the war for Independence was fought majorly by "Upper Caste" Hindus only - a thought that never crossed his mind when he was showering us Upper Caste Hindus with horrific curses of all sorts and spewing venom against us and our rituals? Why does he suddenly remember this when he lost the elections and not when he was contesting them? Or maybe he knew but he intentionally kept mum because (as established in the previous paragraphs) he was loyal to his white masters and wanted for the British Rule to stay? And hence hated the upper castes because they ALSO supported the freedom movement whereas he wanted (until 1946) for the Brits to stay & even proved how the "lower" castes were fighting for the British Rule in [[Dr. Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar#^593da8\|his letter to A.V Alexander]] (the word *lower* often occurs in quotation marks for the reason that I do not believe in any caste being lower than another & that castes are just castes which signify birth and nothing else) 

Where was this *LOVE* for Hindus and Upper-Castes when he wrote a letter to A.V Alexander the literal next year in May 1946? Till the time it was finalised that India was getting Independence and nothing could stop it, "Babasaheb" tried his level best to avoid India gaining Independence. Needless to say, as I have already proven that Ambedkar wrote with hypocrisy so heavy that can crush an elephant to death.

All this hue and cry about him helping the "Untouchables" (as he called them) proved to be discarded. People realised that all his crying about Untouchables is either fake or driven by an anti-Hindu, anti-India agenda or that this term was used to refer to himself and his bandwagon of people who just want to cry and never give solutions.

> "It (referring to the Congress) is made up of Hindus and is fed by the Hindus. It is this majority which constitutes the clientele of the Congress and the Congress, therefore, is bound to protect the rights of its clients"
> "The Congress is deceiving the world by using nationalism as a cloak for a free field for rank communalism" 
> 
> ~ taken from **"Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar, Writings and Speeches, Vol. IX"**, page 172

Ambedkar is mentioned academically only because he was the Drafting Committee Chairman, not for any contribution to the Indian Independence Movement because the able NCERT historians who even whitewashed the Mughals couldn't create something that doesn't exist. Every time I have heard his name in my life up until recently has always had him described as the Drafting Committee Chairman. Even I used to think hasn't he done anything else in life? Why is his name always supplemented by only this as if it's his singular designation he ever held and not anything else? 
The truth is: I have only seen his works in some corner of an old, nearly crumbling library or maybe in the houses of the Ambedkarites and some Bhim Army virgins. No sane person wants to decorate (or deteriorate) their house with such immense negative energy.

# The Failed Politician turned wanna-be God
His famous statement that he was born a Hindu, but he will never die a Hindu is well known and some idols of negativity (normally known as *"Ambedkarites"*) would also hail the same statement as a testament to the fact he was so "fearless".

Fearless, brave and valiant he may be - but it is true that B.R. was nothing more than a failed Politician who announced on 14th October 1956 in a press-conference that he would neither join Hinyana Buddhism, nor Mahayana Buddhism, nor Vajrayana Buddhism. He would take the best from each and form his own sub-sect - [[Navayāna Buddhism\|Navayāna Buddhism]]. 

The best part is, he named it Navayāna ("Nava" meaning "new") as if he is creating something revolutionary which will be remembered for ages to come! The only thing about this decision that I remember it for is how big of a dumpster fire it was.

Mind you that new sects of Buddhism are always created by a [[Bōdhisattva\|Bōdhisattva]] - not by any Tom, Dick or Harry who feels like doing it. Buddhists ignored this sect completely and its just how it is now. They wear the colour blue - which I have not seen any Buddhist Sect do! There is a clear inference that can be drawn (but cannot be refuted) that he wanted to become a Bōdhisattva & that he wished people to follow & worship him.

Why do I call Ambedkarites as "Idols of Negativity"? Because they - unlike other Buddhists - never seem to understand the point of the philosophy that life is a test and sadness is a part of life. They do not even seem to appreciate anything that they are given & always seek to hog up more stuff from the others... It is one thing to not be born with a silver spoon but a copper one, it is a very unfortunate thing to be born without a spoon at all but Ambedkarities believe that the only way to make up for being born with a lack of a spoon is to snatch everyone else's spoons and artificially create equality instead of spending the same energy on working hard. They somehow also feel proud of being able to render other citizens spoonless and assume that when the others complain, it is because they don't want "true equality".

Ambedkarites (unlike other Buddhists) are the most Hindu-hating lot among all the people that identify with any non-Abrahamic religion. They mindlessly question every and all Hindu Rituals, every Hindu Practice, they somehow see Muslims as their breatheren wheras the same Muslims are culling the "Scheduled Castes" in Pakistan and Bangladesh with no problem. They cannot sit straight with a non-Ambedkarite without whining about the injustices (allegedly) done on them by the Brāhmana caste (Brahmins) whereas Authentic Buddhists are never spotted with even a reflection or slither of a grudge against [[Ādi Shankarāchārya\|Ādi Shankarāchārya]] for converting all the Buddhists back to the Hindu Fold! 

His followers are just like him - vengeful, pessimistic cucks who (unlike Ambedkar) don't want to work hard.

# Why he deserves a space on my website
I hold SOME respect for the man since he tried to oppose reservations - a system where all the spoons - silver or copper - would be snatched from their rightful owners and be handed to select people from certain castes & call this new form of casteism as something fair. 
All that respect went down the drain when he was the chairman of the drafting committee & could have dismissed the motion raised in the same meeting in minutes if not seconds. I still hold the sentiment "at least he tried" and that is precisely what permits me to address him as a man and not with every cuss word in all of the 7 languages I know - Hindi, English, Haryanvi, Punjabi, German, Italian and Spanish (although I am very rusty in all European Languages in my arsenal except English).

I developed SOME respect for him when he said that Muslims have one loyalty and that is towards their own muslim brotherhood and never to a particular country. It was amazing how this guy learnt this AFTER living with Jinnah since 1936 & never even once thought to oppose Jinnah despite him being with him all this long.

People applaud him for proposing Sanskrit to be made the National Language of Independent India but few know his hatred of Hinduism. Due to this hatred of his, he probably would have promoted some biased translations of his or use it for his evangelist agendas. I would not trust this man blindly without knowing his reasoning behind things.
