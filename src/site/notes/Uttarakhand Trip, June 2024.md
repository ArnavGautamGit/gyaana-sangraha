# Uttarakhand Trip, June 2024
We started the road trip from Delhi on 26th June 2024 at roughly 6 to 7 AM.

We took a small breakfast stop at the Haldiram, near Muzaffarnagar to eat Puri-Aloo.

We reached our first proper stop at [[Kālsi (कालसी)\|Kālsi (कालसी)]] at roughly 11:30 AM and we took a stop, ate food and Papa showed me around the facility we were staying at: Embryo Biotechnology Training Center. Papa told me it was named so to avoid the connotations attached with the term "Guest House" since then the local politicians, government employees, our other connnections would try to ask for a stay and it would not look nice to say no.

We crossed the Yamuna river from the new bridge in the city adjacent to the old one. The new bridge had water flowing over it during the recent flash-floods. The remanants of the old bridge were also visible.

Activities at Kālsi:
[[Lunch with Dr. Aswal\|Lunch with Dr. Aswal]]
Visit to [[Ashokan Rock Edicts in Kālsi, Uttarakhand\|Ashokan Rock Edicts in Kālsi, Uttarakhand]]

After spending the rest of the day & night at Kālsi, we departed towards our next destination with the morning sun - trip to the town/village of [[Nāgthāt (नागथात)\|Nāgthāt (नागथात)]], where we would stay at the [[FRH Nagthat\|FRH Nagthat]] which is the local [[Forest Rest House\|Forest Rest House]].

Activities at Nāgthāt:
[[Visiting महासु देवता मन्दिर, बिसोई\|Visiting महासु देवता मन्दिर, बिसोई]] (add the english name as alias)
[[Jalebi-testing in the market\|Jalebi-testing in the market]]
[[Trek to the top of the ridge\|Trek to the top of the ridge]]
[[Trek to the edge of the ridge\|Trek to the edge of the ridge]]

After staying at Nāgthāt till 29th June's morning, we took a tea-stop at Kālsi again and saw the dairy farm managed by [[Dr. Ajay Aswal\|Dr. Ajay Aswal]] and another gentleman whose name I believ was [[Dr. Pradip\|Dr. Pradip]] but do not quote me on it. We were too tired to go into the lab. The newer chunk of the facility (comprising of a 30-50% of the whole) was built in similar [[Public Private Partnership (PPP)\|Public Private Partnership (PPP)]] as other such farms used by Papa's Brainchildren: [[Accuvance\|Accuvance]] and [[Nuverto Bioresearch\|Nuverto Bioresearch]].

We also took a small lunch stop at the same Haldiram where my parents ate the Veg Deluxe Thali whereas I ate Chhole Bhature.

We reached home at somewhere between 6-7 PM of 29th June 2024.
