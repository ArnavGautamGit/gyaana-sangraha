# Criteriae for Good Cryptographic Algorithms
We only look for new Algorithms when our old trusted ones are broken.
Keeping the conversation in-line with this thought, the new encryption algorithm must be able to repel against attacks and Techniques used against it earlier and it needs to be fast (like anything else in this day & age)

Hence, there are two main Criteriae against which new [[Cryptographic Encryption Algorithms\|Cryptographic Encryption Algorithms]] are judged:
1. ***==Security from known Cryptanalysis Techniques==***: There are some known techniques of [[Cryptanalysis\|Cryptanalysis]] such as [[Frequency Analysis\|Frequency Analysis]] and [[Exhaustive Key Search\|Exhaustive Key Search]] among others (including the technique that got the old one) which the new Cipher must protect against.
2. ***==Response Time==***: As a wise man once said, "Security is an overhead that needs to be processed" & the faster it gets processed without losing accuracy the better it is, else it will put off the users from using the Secure Service!
