# D&D Combat Rules
> Adventurers encounter many dangerous monsters and nefarious villains. In those moments, combat often breaks out. This note lists out the rules used for combat in the game of [[Compendiums/D&D Compendium/Dungeons & Dragons\|D&D]]. 

Here is the interesting thing: Combat is generally between two sides in the game but could be between 3 or more sides too. In either case combat takes place in an order of turns which is decided when the players Roll for [[Initiative Roll\|Initiative]]. 
For Damage or Healing from combat & non-combat sources: [[D&D Damage & Healing Rules\|D&D Damage & Healing Rules]].

### The Order of Combat
Firstly, we establish the position of the player characters with respect to their surroundings and enemies. Most [[Dungeon Master (DM)\|DMs]] use Visual Aids like Maps, tokens and figurines to achieve this. Visual Aids are such a good help that it has become the main way to play.

After that we make the [[Initiative Roll\|Initiative Roll]] where the character/adversary who rolls the highest goes first on the turn order, then the character/adversary that rolls the second highest goes second and so on. In case of two Player Characters (PCs) having a tie, the players may resolve this amongst themselves while the [[Dungeon Master (DM)\|DM]] decides the turn order in case of a tie among them. If there is a tie between adversaries. If there is a tie between a PC and a adversary - the DM can decide themselves based on whether most of the party is taking their turn before the adversaries or after them & balance the encounter accordingly. However it is a common courtesy to simply ask the player if they would like to go before the adversary/monster in case the DM feels the encounter is balanced either way.

Lastly, the players can now take turns and continue the combat once Initiative order is established. The player characters (PCs) can move the maximum distance equal to their speed and take one Action along with 1 Bonus Action unless they have an ability that allows them to take more [[D&D Action Rules\|Actions]] in the same turn.

### Movement
As mentioned earlier, PCs can move the distance equal to their speed or less.
However you deduct the distance of each part of your movement from your speed until your speed is used up or until you are done moving, whichever comes first.
A character's Speed is determined during [[D&D Character Creation\|Character Creation]]. 
A monster's Speed is noted in the monster's stat block.

### Cover
Walls, trees, creatures, and other obstacles can provide cover, making a target more difficult to harm. There are three degrees of cover, each of which gives a different benefit to a target.

For half & three-quarters cover we add +2 or +5 to the target's AC if you are attacking from the direction where the cover is actually protecting the target. If you change your angle of approach or go around cover then things might be different.


> [!tip] Tip: Unseen Attackers & Targets!
> When you are rolling against a target in full cover that you can't see, you get a disadvantage on rolls against them. This is true whether you're guessing the target's location or targeting a creature you can hear but not see. lf the target isn't in the location you targeted, you miss. 
> When a creature can't see you, you have Advantage on attack rolls against it. lf you are hidden when you make an attack roll, you give away your location when the attack hits or misses.

### Melee Combat
Melee Combat with melee weapons like swords, maces and spears requires both the parties to be within 5 feet of each other unless of one or both of them have a spell, ability or weapon that allows them to attack the other from larger distance. For such cases, it is mentioned in the description/character sheet/stat block of said creature, any of their abilities or spells. 

Opportunity Attacks can be triggered by any PC or adversary.
Making them is easy - it is an automatic reaction.
Defending against them however is a pain in the derrière since they cannot be devended against and the only way of avoiding them is by disengaging.

### Ranged Combat
Ranged Combat is defined as using a thrown melee weapon or proper ranged weapons like bows, longbows and crossbows among other ranged options. Proper ranged weapons have a disadvantage if within 5 feet of any adversary that can see the PC and is not [[D&D Conditions\|Incapacitated]].

Some ranged attacks, such as those made with a Longbow, have two ranges. The smaller number is the normal range, and the larger number is the long range. Your attack roll has Disadvantage when your target is beyond normal range, and you can't attack a target beyond long range.


### Mounted Combat
Mounted Combat is combat while one of the parties is on horseback or atop another mount animal like a Griffin or Dragon. During your move, you can mount a creature that is within 5 feet of you or dismount. Doing so costs an amount of movement equal to half your Speed (round down). For example, if your Speed is 30 feet, you spend 15 feet of movement to mount a horse. 

You can control a mount only if it has been trained to accept a rider. Domesticated horses, mules, and similar creatures have such training. The Initiative of a controlled mount changes to match yours when you mount it. It moves on your turn as you direct it, and it has only three action op tions during that turn: Dash, Disengage, and Dodge. A controlled mount can move and act even on the turn that you mount it. In contrast, an independent mount-one that lets you ride but ignores your control-retains its place in the Initiative order and moves and acts as it likes.

If you wish to move against your mount you must pass a Dex Saving Throw with [[Difficulty Class (DC)\|DC]] of 10 to move the mount against its will or fall off.

### Underwater Combat
Here are a few rules if you want to run combat underwater like this is Atlantis.
- Unless your melee weapons of choice have piercing damage or your character has a dedicated Swim Speed, you have disadvantage on all attack roles with those melee weapons.
- A ranged attack roll with a weapon (like a bow) underwater automatically misses a target beyond the weapon's normal range, and the attack roll has Disadvantage against a target within normal range. 
- Anything underwater has Resistance to Fire damage.

### Damage & Healing
All Damage & Healing from said damage is done using the [[D&D Damage & Healing Rules\|D&D Damage & Healing Rules]].
Regardless of what the type of combat it is - Melee, Ranged & Mounted - or even fall damage & non-combat damage.
