# Kārṣāpaṇa Coins
> Pronounced as "Kaarshaapana" and also spelled as Karsapana, these were a class of stamped coins popular during the age of the [[Mauryan Empire\|Mauryan Empire]] and [[Sātavāhana Empire\|Sātavāhana Empire]].

Altough the oldest one of the Kārṣāpaṇa Coins that were discovered are from 5th Century BC, it is unknown when exactly these punch-marked coins originated.

### Construction
Usually made of Silver or Copper, these punch-marked coins were primarily utilised a piece of silver/alloy which was stamped with a specific seal and other identification material to avoid Counterfeiting. Due to being simple stamped coins, these were not able to get complex details - only simpler basic shapes and seals.

While the [[Mauryan Empire\|Mauryans]] stuck to making Coins using Silver and Copper based coins with Copper being the lowest denomination, the [[Sātavāhana Empire\|Sātavāhans]] also used an alloy of Lead, Copper and Tin called "Potin" for the lowest denominations apart from Silver and Copper Coins. Although Copper Coins was rarer because it oxidises rapidly & exponentially compared to Silver which oxidises fast to a certain degree but not beyond a certain level. Many believe that was the reason for Potin coins.

### Circulation
Kārṣāpana formed the primary currency of many kingdoms and empires of the era and even later eras. It was important that later coins made of pure Gold like [[Dinar Coins\|Dinar Coins]] were a premium currency that was not in as widespread use.
