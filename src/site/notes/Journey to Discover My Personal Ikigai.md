# Journey to Discover My Ikigai
Pre-requisite: [[Ikigai (Japanese Concept)\|Ikigai (Japanese Concept)]]
This is an evolving note.

This is my documented journey to discover myself and my purpose/calling in life.
Just like any other journey, here is the list of stuff we require:
1. Do I love it?
2. Am I good at it?
3. Can I get paid for it?
4. Does it solve a problem at scale?
	1. Will the world pay for getting it? (or they want it for free)

Once we have that then we can easily figure out what my calling in Life is by adding them in the "Jobs & Businesses" column of the table below and check for the conditions as we listed above.
