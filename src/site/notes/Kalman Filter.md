# Kalman Filter
> An algorithmic Process that can estimate observable and unobservable parameters with great accuracy in real-time. Estimates with high accuracy are used to make precise predictions and decisions. For these reasons, Kalman Filters are used in robotics and real-time systems that need reliable information.

It can use inaccurate or noisy measurements to estimate the state of that variable or another unobservable variable with greater accuracy. For example, Kalman Filtering is used to do the following:
- Object Tracking – Use the measured position of an object to more accurately estimate the position and velocity of that object.
- Body Weight Estimate on Digital Scale – Use the measured pressure on a surface to estimate the weight of object on that surface.
- Guidance, Navigation, and Control – Use Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors to estimate an objects location, velocity, and acceleration; and use those estimates to control the objects next moves.

The process diagram below shows the Kalman Filter algorithm step by step.
