# Cookies vs Spyware
On the surface, [[Internet Cookies\|Cookies]] and [[Spyware\|Spyware]] both track data but there are differences in how they are made.

While on one hand, Cookies are offline and stored on your PC rather in the open whereas the Spyware may try to hide using a [[Trojan Horse (Malware)\|Trojan Horse (Malware)]] or [[Rootkit (Malware)\|Rootkit (Malware)]] component but it will try to stay invisible.

Cookies only track certain website data and each website has its own cookie that gets overridden. Spyware tracks everything, even your offline presence and non-browser metrics. Average spyware collect WAYYYY more data than Cookies.

Unlike Spyware, Cookies can be deleted at will.
