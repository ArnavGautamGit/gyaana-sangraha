# Major Inscriptions of Ancient India
> Note that lists all the major inscriptions and [[Epigraphy\|epigraphs]] made in the [[Ancient Indian History\|Ancient Indian History]] and have survived & been found today.

the list of Inscriptions across these notes have been divided into different time-periods like Mauryan, Post-Mauryan etc. Please scroll to the relevant sections for the same.

### Mauryan Era (Ashoka's Reign)
Oldest Epigraphs in India are the [[Ashokan Edicts\|Ashokan Edicts]] erected on the demand of Emperor [[Ashoka\|Ashoka]] - third ruler of the [[Mauryan Empire\|Mauryan Empire]]. There were 15 Minor Ashokan Edicts before the he ordered 14 Major Ashokan Edicts and 7 major Pillar Edicts. His official orders were also put up as pillar edicts but are called minor pillar edicts. I have visited one of the 14 major rock edicts and the last one in North India - [[Ashokan Rock Edicts in Kālsi, Uttarakhand\|Ashokan Rock Edicts in Kālsi]].

### Post-Mauryan Phase
In the Post-Mauryan Phase, many independent kingdoms came to be in different parts of the country. Heliodoros writes about Krishna worship in Besnagar, Vidisha (engraved by Garudadhwaja).

In Central India, we have edicts by [[Sātavāhana Empire\|Sātavāhana Empire]] which have two major inscriptions - one in Naaneghat where Queen Nayanika/Naganika talks about [[Satakarni I\|Satakarni I]] and the other being the Naashik inscriptions where Queen Gautami Balasari talks about her son [[Gautamiputra Satakarni\|Gautamiputra Satakarni]].

[[Rudraman I\|Rudraman I]] of the [[Western Kshatrapa\|Western Kshatrapa]] gets a new inscription in Junagarh (Girnar) were he mentions how he got the hydro-dam repaired on Lake Sudarshan - giving us the first Sanskrit inscription.

### Gupta Period
[[Hari Sena\|Hari Sena]] gets a new inscription carved which mentions [[Samudragupta\|Samudragupta]] & if his words are to be trusted, then Samudragupta did not see a single loss in his entire military career.

### Chalukyan Period
