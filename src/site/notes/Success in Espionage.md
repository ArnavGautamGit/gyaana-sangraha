# Success in Espionage - what it is and how it is defined
- Quit fixating on how much is known, strive to know what is unknown & what might be delibrately leaked
- There is a massive premium in collecting advance data of different kinds that must be converted into information and processed & analysed for consumption \[by the government]
- Success depends on clarity of purpose set by the government, in-house talent and morale of the same.
