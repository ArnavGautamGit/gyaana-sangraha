# Ashoka
> The third & the last major ruler of [[Mauryan Empire\|Mauryan Empire]] - one of the sons of [[Bindusāra Maurya\|Bindusāra Maurya]].

Ruled over the Mauryan Empire's most brutal war followed by the empire's most peaceful age. He was a controversial figure & often likened to Ancient India's [[Aurangzeb\|Aurangzeb]] by a few but unlike him, Ashoka actually went on a redemption arc.

### Ascension to the Throne
If Buddhist sources are to be considered then it is said that Ashoka was not a handsome prince but rather looked quite hideous. It is said that he assassinated or killed all his 100 brothers to ascend the throne for himself. Although the number of brothers he had seems to be hyperbolic - it is well known that [[Bindusāra Maurya\|Bindusāra]], his father had many wives and he had many half brothers with a frequently named one being Sushīma. Even the Hindu sources agree that he had half-brothers but it is unknown whether him assassinating all of them to ascend the throne is hyperbolic or not.

### Conversion to Buddhism
There is a popular myth that Ashoka turned Buddhist in his 9th or 10th Regnal Year after the War with Kalinga but it is popularly noted by Indian Historians that Ashoka had already converted to [[Bauddha (Buddhism)\|Buddhism]] in his 5th Regnal Year (4 years prior) but he became an especially devout "Dhammic" Buddhist after he saw the horrors of that war.

### Kalinga Conquest
His only conquest throughout his reign came in his 9th Regnal Year, Kalinga was the land in modern-day Odisha which always had tendencies of revolt & independence similar to Bengal. It was also the region where the local army was dense despite a much smaller territory it controlled for a similarly sized military. Many Casualties took place in this war. 

The description of the aftermath goes that Ashoka could see the bodies of soldiers (on both sides) being eaten by vultures since there were about 100,000 casualties in those days (not population adjusted) which were too many to cremate in time. Most of the bodies were missing limbs or even faces. It is also mentioned how there was a thick enough pool of blood in many places around the battlefield that Ashoka could see his own face as clearly in its reflection as if boating through a lake of water. Ashoka writes how he saw a little girl crying and panicking when trying to find her father in the piles of bodies as her mother (pregnant with a second child) walks right behind her trying to calm her child down - while weeping herself for her husband...

Watching these horrors firsthand made something trigger in Ashoka, he saw the humanity in people and the futility of war - he saw how he massacred an entire kingdom for nothing but his ego and the human greed. This is when he made the decision to use his power for the betterment of society and promote an ideology of peace & tranquility that he personally could believe in ([[Bauddha (Buddhism)\|Buddhism]]).

### Promotion of Buddhism
Ashoka promoted [[Bauddha (Buddhism)\|Buddhism]] in two distinct ways depending upon whether he is doing so internally within his territory or in foreign lands. 

For promoting the Dhammic way of life internally in India, he decided that he would raise awareness with epigraphs and rock edicts that he would add in many places. He already had a few pillar edicts made in his 8th Regnal Year but they were more of administrative writings. See: [[Ashokan Edicts\|Ashokan Edicts]] for details.

To promote Dhammic way of life in foreign lands & "around the world" he sent one group of devotees to take the [[Bauddha (Buddhism)\|Buddhist Philosophy]] in each direction - one group woud depart to the North, another to the South, another to the West and another to the East. This decision would spread the word of Buddhism very rapidly - eventually until before the advent of [[Abrahamic Religions\|Abrahamic Religions]] such as [[Islam\|Islam]] and [[Christianity\|Christianity]], all of Asia was Buddhist. Even today, much of Eastern Asia is Buddhist.
