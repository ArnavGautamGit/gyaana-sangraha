# Dīkshā
> Process of Initiation that differes from one Sampradāya to another and whether the person/student is initiated within [[Vaishnava Tradition of Hinduism\|Vaishnavism]], [[Shaiva Tradition in Hinduism\|Shaivism]] or [[Shākta Tradition in Hinduism\|Shaktism]] the process may be radically different from one another.

A person that has taken a Dīkshā in any Sampradāya is called as Dīkshita, this is also where the brahmin surname "Dixit", "Dikshit" and other spelling variants originate.

### Common Place Traditions
In most traditions, Diksha often includes the change of name so that the person is now Dvija (Twice-born) i.e., they start a new life under a new name - although on government papers the name remains the same.
