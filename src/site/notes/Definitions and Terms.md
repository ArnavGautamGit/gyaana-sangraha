# What is meant by the term - "Constitution"?
- The word ‘Constitution’ is developed from the word ‘Constitute’, which means ‘to frame or to establish or to compose’.
- It defines the relationship between the rulers and the ruled and how rulers are created in the country.
- It upholds the principle that all citizens are equal before the law.
- Any law which is not in accordance with the Constitution becomes invalid
# Why was the Constitution made?
The Indian Constitution is an important instrument which confers powers, rights, functions, principles, restrictions and obligations on the part of individuals, states and everybody who are the citizens of India.
The purpose of the Constitution is to maintain harmonious relations between the individuals and the states on the one hand and between the different organs of the government on the other
# What is the basic structure of such an important text?
The Constitution can be broadly broken into 3 structural categories:
1. ==Federal Structure==: That it is to say there exists both State and Central forms of Governments.
2. ==Supremacy of the Constitution==: All the authorities derive their powers, rights, duties and obligations from the Constitution.
3. ==Distribution of Powers==: The distribution of power for running the country effectively has been done on the Principle of *"Doctrine of Separation of Powers"*.
# History of The Indian Constitution
1. The Work on Indian Constitution started in 13th December, 1946 (at the presentation of "Objective Resolution") by Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru and was adopted on 22nd January, 1947. However, it should also be noted that the idea of a Constituent Assembly for India for the first time was put forward by **M.N. Roy** - who was a pioneer of the communist movement in India in 1934.
2. Dr. Sachchidananda Sinha was the first president (temporary) of the Constituent Assembly when it met on December 9, 1946.
3. Later, Dr. Rajendra Prasad became the President of the Constituent Assembly and Dr. Bhimrao Ambedkar became the Chairman of its drafting committee on December 11,1946.
4. Dr. BN Rau became the Constitutional Advisor of the Constituent Assembly around the same time. He is often described as the Architect of the Indian Constitution (He also helped Burma build their Constitution)
5. Dr B. R. Ambedkar in his concluding speech in constituent assembly on 25 November 1949 stated that:  
   >"The credit that is given to me does not really belong to me. It belongs partly to Sir B.N.
   >The draft of his consisted of 243 articles and 13 schedules which came to 395 articles and 8 schedules after discussions, debates and amendments."
