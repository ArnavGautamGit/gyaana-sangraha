# Cyber Security Terminology
A collection of all important Terminology one needs to know to understand Cyber Security Concepts.
## Security
> "Refers to the protection of [[Cyber Security Terminology#Assets\|#Assets]]  and by extension, also encompass protection the devices where the assets are located/stored and the users which the assets are useful to."

A Computer System is never fully secure. Never.
However, when we say that a system is secure, we say that the common attacks of the day can be protected against.
A secure system is supposed to be one which can do the following three against attacks:
1. Prevention - using the [[Attack Prevention Triad\|Attack Prevention Triad]]
2. Detection - using some sort of [[Intrusion Detection and Prevention\|Intrusion Detection and Prevention]] System
3. Reaction / Recovery - [[System Data Recovery\|System Data Recovery]]

---
## Assets
> Assests are the things to be secured.

Assets are of 3 kinds: Hardware, Software and Data.
Hardware is your CPU, RAM, SSD/HDD, Mouse, Keyboard, Monitor etc.
Software is your Operating System, your apps etc.
Data is... self explanatory.

---
## Vulnerabilities
> Weaknesses that can be exploted by an [[Cyber Security Terminology#Attacker\|#Attacker]] to cause harm to the system and/or its Assets and/or its user(s).

Vulnerabilities can evolve into [[Cyber Security Terminology#Threats\|#Threats]]

---
## Threats
> "Set of circumstances that can cause harm"
> OR
> "When Vulnerabilities are exploited to attack the system"

My phone (without password protection) lying inside a locked room is a vulnerability... if I take it out and leave it somewhere in public, that mistake converts the vulnerability into a threat. Various types of Threats are detailed in [[Classification of Cyber Threats\|Classification of Cyber Threats]]

---
## Attacker
> An entity that attacks or is a threat to the system - could be human or a bot.

Human Attackers are often known as "[[Hackers\|Hackers]]" or "[[Black-Hat Hackers\|Black-Hat Hackers]]" more specifically.

---
## Attack
Also known as: Cyber Attack, Hacking Attack etc.
> Action that exploits a Threat and intends to harm the system, its assets or its user (s).

> Also defined as: **an action that exploits a vulnerability**

See Also: [[Types of Cyber Attacks\|Types of Cyber Attacks]]

---
## Risk
> "The potential that a given threat will exploit vulnerabilities of an asset or group of assets and thereby cause harm to the organization."

Risk shows the damage caused to the system assets by the occurrence of threats.
There are multiple methods to find its value:
[[The OWASP Method\|The OWASP Method]]
[[The CRAMM\|The CRAMM]]
