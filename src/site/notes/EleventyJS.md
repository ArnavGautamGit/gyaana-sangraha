# EleventyJS
> A [[JavaScript\|JavaScript]]-based _static site generator_. It takes a folder of templates (Markdown, HTML, etc.) and produces a fully static website (HTML/CSS) as output. 

Eleventy pre-renders pages with zero client-side JavaScript by default, so the result is very fast and simple to host. It’s essentially an alternative to Jekyll, built on Node/JavaScript, and supports many template languages (Markdown, Liquid, Nunjucks, etc.)

Because Eleventy doesn’t inject its own markup or require a frontend framework, programmers have complete control over the HTML/CSS it produces.
