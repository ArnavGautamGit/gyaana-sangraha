# Spotlight (2015)
> Movie based on a 600 article long series exposing the institutionised paedophilia & coverup of the same done by the Cathoilic Church. First exposed by the Spotlight team in The Boston Globe. 

This is my third [[Blu-Ray Discs\|Blu-Ray Disc]] after [[Baby Driver (2017)\|Baby Driver (2017)]] and [[Detective Pikachu (2019)\|Detective Pikachu (2019)]] and definitely worthy of all the awards & acclaim this movie has received. Although I must admit that it is hard to understand all Christian references made in the movie if you are not an American Christian or at least well-read with Catholic Church Ranks - which I was not. It does not mean I did not understand the movie at all, it just meant I had to pause a little.

### Movie Review
While I bought the disc from the same vendor on Amazon as the other ones, this disc had microsmudges on the back of the disc presumably from poor handling. It is still however a great play. It did skip along the one scene where Rezendes (played by Mark Ruffalo) goes to meet Garbadein or whatever the guy was named It was at the 18th minute but the recovery bits on the bluray worked fine resulting in the disc pausing and playing from 1 second back & I was able to listen to the whole dialogue.

My speakers were shaking even on 20% volume - which is a testament to great sound quality of the movie that could be felt on cheap 20-30 year old stereo speakers bought for less than the INR equivalent of $20 USD back then in India. It was due to this great audio that I did not mind the subtitles not having a text background & often bleeding/dissapearing into the back of the scene if the scene had a lot whites right where the text would be.

Due to the Director Tom McCarthy (who also wrote the screenplay along with another writer) already having won an academy award in 2009 for Up. Now he won another for Spotlight & it was well-deserved for the visual treat we got.

The cast does a great job of elevating the screenplay & direction even further with legends like Michael Keaton, Mark Ruffalo among other prominent actors who lit up the screen with their stardom and class.

### Revelations made by The Boston Globe
While the movie deals with the challenges that came with getting the first article out to have the victims voice themselves - eventually the articles brought the readership of the Boston Globe back up & even won them a Pulitzer Prize for it. 

The movie shows how the Church controlled the judges and even lawyers & the courthouses so even those documents that have been made puclic by the virtue of being a public judicial report were redacted by the church using their connections.

The movie ends with other victims who kept mum out of shame & guilt to come out & tell their stories. It can be inferred that these are the stories which were contained in the other 599 articles released by The Globe along with additional evidence. 

However the main meat of the story came after the movie ended. The movie released the numbers that this could be bigger than [[The Epstein Files\|The Epstein Files]] on the basis of the sheer number of kids which form the list of victims. It is estimated that the number may reach 1000 kids. All these 600 articles were posted in 2002 itself forcing the Cardinal Law to resign (Cardinal Law of the Catholic Church is actually a position presided by a Cardinal, not a document like a Constitution of any nation) 

The End Credits of the movie exposed the entire ring of paedophilia that the Catholic Church spread was not limited to the city of Boston in the USA... it stretched to almost all of the USA and even other countries where the Catholic Church is present. I am attaching snapshots from the movie below. Since tking screenshots is prohibited by the PS4's firmware, I have clicked the following photos by hand suing my phone..

Similar Scandals to the one in Boston committed by the Catholic Church were found in the following locations: ![Spotlight 2.jpg](/img/user/Vaulted%20Images/Spotlight%202.jpg)

Before you think this rot is only limited to the USA, it happened everywhere the Catholic Church exists...![Spotlight 4.jpg](/img/user/Vaulted%20Images/Spotlight%204.jpg)

These paedophiles even reached India via the Churches setup in pre-colonial, colonial & the post-colonial times by major powers from Portuguese all the way to Catholic Missionaries (the movie names the Ollur area in Thrissur, Kerela where [even the padre named Kokken was SENTENCED after 9 years](https://hindupost.in/crime/pocso-court-sentences-pedophile-kokken/#)) 

See the third name in the central column of names to see Ollur, India being named.
