# VoIP Numbers
> VoIP stands for "Voice over [[Internet Protocol (IP)\|Internet Protocol]]" meaning these are virtual numbers that do not exist physically but via the Internet Protocol used as an identifier.

VoIP numbers can be shut down anytime, you can give out new ones any moment you feel like & can even have separate ones that you can use accordingly.

### Considerations for non-USA residents
One needs a high-speed internet connection which is consistent.
Secondly if you live in a country like India where VoIP have heavy KYC walls & even charges on incoming calls, with VoIP service providers not even taking you seriously unless you have a registered GST number (used by businesses) then VoIP is not feasible as a privacy tool for you.

### How is it different from Phone Numbers?
Conventional phone numbers use SIM cards which connect to telecom towers and ping them to maintain connection. This same connection can be used to track them. Not to mention how each SIM has an prefix for each country so a person can figure out which country you are from without even getting to know your number.

With conventional phone numbers using a SIM card, you cannot use more numbers than the number of slots a particular device has. VoIP numbers allow you to have 100s of numbers in an app.

Even if you want to use a SIM card, it is best to not give it out anymore & start changing out the numbers in most places. Certain services like Amazon and others may need to have the account shut down.

### How to move towards VoIP and abandon SIMs?
The process of moving away from your SIM is rather quite simple and can be done with a few simple steps but these will take time & if you have a SIM that you have used everywhere this will take an exceptionally long time:
1. Port your old number to VoIP provider of choice.
	1. This number will be a receiving-only number which will take calls straight into voicemail & email the transcripts to you. You can choose how to respond.
	2. This number is only to tell people that it is no longer active.
2. Now, if you want get a new (prepaid) SIM card but only use it for data, never share the number associated with it & only use VoIP numbers for communication.
3. Compartmentalise your life into different compartments using different VoIP Numbers.

### Disadvantages of ditching SIMs entirely
If you want to ditch SIMs entirely due to their tracking & spam, you can avoid that completely by just not getting a new simcard after you convert your old one to VoIP or shut it down completely.

If you do let go of your SIM entirely, you will not be able to stay connected in any place that does not have a Wi-Fi. There is no way to take calls if you do not have a Wi-Fi connection. No calls can be taken on the go & you cannot do anything.
