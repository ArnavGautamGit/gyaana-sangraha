# Football Clubs as Businesses
> A note that uses all my knowledge of Business and applies it to one of my favourite hobbies that are one of the largest businesses around the world - [[Football Clubs\|Football Clubs]].

Football Clubs (in business terms) are either [[Limited Liability Proprietorship (LLP)\|LLPs]] or [[Private Limited Company\|Pvt Ltd Companies]] whose main product or service is the sport of [[Football\|Football]]. 
All [[Football Clubs\|Football Clubs]] are considered bad businesses regardless of their size and that is because of unstable income coupled with being Capital Intensive.

### Income Sources
Although income sources differ from region-to-region & league-to-league. Most of the times, the organisers of the league have to pay a certain percentage of broadcasting revenue to the clubs - often in the order they finished in the league i.e., winner gets most, runner-up gets second-most and so on.

On top of this, clubs often sign advertisement deals to send their players for acting in advertisements for particular products where the money is either kept by the club or shared among the club and players.

By far the most popular and the most easiest way of getting money is via having sponsors who pay a certain sum of money to display their business's name and logo on the jerseys and kits worn by the players and showed around the stadium. The exact sum is dependent upon the club's value, viewership and location on the jerseys.

A less popular method which is employed by super-rich clubs is that they approach their sponsors to sponsor a stadium either:
1. Title Sponsorship (stop sponsoring and we remove your name from our Stadium name) 
2. Stadium Sponsorship (sponsor pays partially or completely for the construction of the stadium)

Good examples of this happening are the Spotify Camp Nou Stadium and the Etihad Stadium.
Sometimes Clubs may even come together to get their stadiums built similar to how San Siro is being rebuilt in collaboration of [[AC Milan\|AC Milan]] and [[Inter Milan\|Inter Milan]].

Sometimes advertisers and sponsors buy direct ownership into the teams by purchasing [[Company Shares\|Company Shares]] at the time of next round of raising [[Paid-Up Capital\|Paid-Up Capital]]. 
Groups such as the [[City Football Group\|City Football Group]] own [[Manchester City FC\|Manchester City FC]], [[Mumbai City FC\|Mumbai City FC]] among other teams with at least 1 club in each continent.

### Capital-Intensive but Zero Assets
The main [[Asset\|Assets]] for a Football Club include the players, coaching staff, practice equipment. Larger Clubs may also own a Stadium or Practice Ground of their own but most Football Clubs never get big enough to own their own stadiums on their own [[Land\|Land]]. Most rent the stadiums from the government.

So all-in-all, apart from the players, coaching staff and other employees themselves the Football Clubs have next to no assets. No Land, No Buildings, maybe a few busses to ferry the players but nothing else. No Assets mean no Collateral which means the club cannot approach any bank for [[Borrowed Capital\|Borrowed Capital]].

### Uncontrolled Wage Inflation
With [[Paid-Up Capital\|Paid-Up Capital]] as the only way to raise [[Capital\|Capital]], each Club needs to perform and win as many titles as they can attract more sponsors and investors. Each Club needs to get better players to do so and whenever the clubs go into the market to get a new player in the next [[Transfer Window\|Transfer Window]] other clubs try to extract as much money as they can in the form of Fees such as [[Transfer Fees\|Transfer Fees]] and [[Player Sell-on Clause\|Player Sell-on Clause]]. This is because all clubs are in the same boat.

This leads to the cost of acquiring a new player higher and much worse for the buying club because they need to see if the club can generate more revenue from signing a player than the club is going to spend on said player.

Often players also negotiate a higher salary when they wish to stay at the club because they think that the reason the club hasn't sold them means the club is earning more than the amount being spent on the player. So even those players that have been playing for a long time at the club tend to have the same problem of inflation.

### Overall Conclusion
Overall, any [[Football Clubs\|Football Club (FC)]] has very little chance of getting institutional investment from Banks and the only institutions that may want to invest are those that do so in promising
