# Truth about Congress
Political Party named "*Indian National Congress*" is a blot on India, her democracy, her culture and her very being.
Here in this note, we explore why.

Jawahar Lal Nehru didn't become the Prime Minister on 15th August 1947, he became the PM almost an year ago - in September 1946. His oath taking ceremony was conducted according to the Cabinet Plan by "Lord" Mountabatten under the Union Jack where Nehru took oath on his loyalty to THE QUEEN (and not the country he was about to be the PM of, not under the flag of the country he became the PM of)

All of this ocurred AFTER he used Gandhi's name and Gandhi arm-twisted the Constituent Assembly with his handwritten note to Saradar Patel that Jawahar should be the PM instead of Sardar Patel even though Patel WON the election 12-1 against Jawahar...

SHRI SHRI ~~Mohandas Karamchand~~ "Mahatma" Gandhi once said, "Hindus should not harbor anger against Muslims, even if the latter wanted to destroy them. Even if the Muslims wanted to kill us all, we should face death bravely"
Quoted from:
The Complete works of Mahatma Gandhi: Talk with Delegates from Viet Nam Page 218 to 219.

According to the book, "The South African Gandhi" where it is mentioned (and it is a well known fact) that Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi fought for the British in the Boer War! He rose to the rank of Sgt. Major! He served his white masters for 29 long years first in the British South African Army and later as a lawyer in South Africa.
Suddenly he gets so famous in India almost as soon as he arrived and he gets all this fame overnight?

## Kharge's Lok Sabha Bastion
Mallikarjuna Kharge, the new Congress Chief (a puppet of Sonia Gandhi/Antonia Maino) always contests Lok Sabha elections from Kalaburagi and it is considered his bastion in Karnataka. Let's see the facts:

Kalaburagi is one of Karnataka's poorest districts.
[Poverty Index shows Kalyana-Karnataka region in poorest light](https://www.newindianexpress.com/states/karnataka/2024/Jan/17/poverty-index-shows-kalyana-karnataka-region-in-poorest-light)

> The ‘National Multi-dimensional Poverty Index (MPI) Report: A Progressive Review 2023’ has found four districts of Kalyana-Karnataka region — Yadgir, Raichur, Kalaburagi and Koppal — to be the poorest in the state.

[Per capita income gap between Karnataka's richest, poorest districts widens](https://archive.fo/DFXYN)
> The average income in Bengaluru Urban, which continues to be the richest district in the state, was Rs 6.2 lakh in FY22 (for which data is last available). This is almost 5x higher than the income in Kalaburagi, the poorest district with a per capita income of Rs 1.2 lakh.

This is this guy's "work". From 1999 to 2019, Kalaburagi was under Congress. Kharge was the MP for 10 years from 2009 to 2019. He lost the last elections to a BJP candidate and is not even contesting this year. Congress has put him into Rajya Sabha

### The Reality of "Godi Media"
Ravish Kumar calls everyone else as "Godi Media" even though the Star News Channel (NDTV's joint venture with Rupert Murdoch's Star Network) was launched in the Official Residence of the then serving Indian Prime Minister Mr. I.K Gujral in 1998! 
NDTV celebrated their 25th Anniversary in the Rashtrapati Bhavan (President's House) in the national capital during the tenure of Shri Pranab Mukherjee.
The channel live telecasted many of our sensitive military outposts during a WAR!
Example: Barkha Dutt's interview with Capt. Vikram Batra in Kargil War (1999) which involved Dutt revealing the location of one if not several of our outposts...
If Godi Media was sitting in Modi's Godi (lap) then in whose lap/godi were Ravish and Barkha among other "independent" and "unbiased" journalists sitting in?

## Adhir
**Defending Sam Pitroda's 'racist' analogy comparing people in South to Africans and those in East to Chinese**, Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said the **country has "Proto-Australian, N!gger type class and Mongoloid class**" and that "not everyone looks alike".

According to the topography of our country regional feature also differs. That what we are taught...not everyone looks alike. **Some are black...some are white. It's obvious!**" said Congress Lok Sabha candidate from West Bengal's Baharampur.
