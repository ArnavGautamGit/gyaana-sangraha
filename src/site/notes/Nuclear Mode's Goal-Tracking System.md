### Daily Tasks
The Tasks that are repeated at a Frequency, check Tasks App. Some of the tasks could be stuff like: Completing College Notes and Learning from the React Native Course.

All one needs is to find a way to stay accountable to the goals & tasks for the day. Since it is an era of technology, one needs an app to keep them accountable and often gamification of productivity is a good way of staying accountable. 
So there is a big clash between Habitica (representing gamified productivity) and Tasks.org App (representing serious productivity).

### Progress
Each Day has a Score. The Score for a day is calculated by the following Formula:
$$\Large Score =\dfrac{Task \ Done}{Total \ Tasks}$$
After the Score is Determined, we assign a Rating to the day as a number from 1-5.
The Weekly Rating is the average of all the individual days in a week. The Monthly Rating is the average of Weekly Rating.
