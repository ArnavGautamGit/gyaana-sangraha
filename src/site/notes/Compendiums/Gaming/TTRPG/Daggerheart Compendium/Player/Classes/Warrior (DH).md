# Warrior (DH)
> A [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/DH Character Creation#Character Class\|Character Class]] of strong soldiers who may be a part of organised military or mercenary or a lone wolf. Known for great [[Strength\|Strength]] and Skill. More Agile than [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Classes/Guardian (DH)\|Guardians]] but unlike Guardians, cannot protect others from harm

The only equivalent in [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/D&D Compendium/Dungeons & Dragons\|D&D]] is the [[Fighter (D&D)\|Fighter (D&D)]].

### Domains
Domains of a class decide the Domain Cards (and abilities) one gets to pick up.
Each Class has 2 fixed Domains.
The Warrior's Domains are: [[Blade\|Blade]] and [[Bone\|Bone]].

### Base Scores
Base [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Evasion Score\|Evasion Score]]: 11
Base [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/General/Hit Point Slots\|Hit Point Slots]]: 6

### Class Items
Each Class has a specific item they choose which will be a plot point in the story. They
must choose one of the options.
For a Warrior, choose EITHER *"Drawing of a Lover"* OR *"Sharpening Stone"*

### Warrior's Hope - Special Ability
***No Mercy:*** Spend 3x [[Hope Token\|Hope Token]] to get a +1 bonus on all attack rolls until next rest.

### Class Features
***Attack of Opportunity:*** If an adversary within Melee range attempts to leave that range, make a reaction roll using a trait of your choice against their Difficulty. 
Choose one effect on a success, (or two on critical success):
- They can’t move from where they are.
- You deal damage to them equal to your primary weapon’s damage.
- You move with them.

***Combat Training*** allows the Warrior to ignore burden & when you deal physical damage, you gain a bonus to your damage roll equal to your level.

### Class Foundations (Subclasses)
There are two subclasses which (in my opinion) are not that different mechanically & the choice depends on playstyle.

- ***==Call of the Slayer==*** allows the player to strike down enemies with damage & power.
	- ***Foundation Feature***
		- ***Slayer:*** You gain a pool of dice called Slayer Dice. On a roll with Hope, you can place a d6 on this card instead of gaining 1x [[Hope Token\|Hope Token]], adding the die to the pool. You can store a number of Slayer Dice equal to your Proficiency. When you make an attack roll or damage roll, you can spend any number of these Slayer Dice, rolling them and adding their result to the roll. At the end of each session, clear any unspent Slayer Dice on this card and gain a Hope per die cleared.
	- ***Specialisation Feature***
		- ***Weapon Specialist:*** You can wield multiple weapons with dangerous ease. When you succeed on an attack, you can spend a Hope to add one of the damage dice from your secondary weapon to the damage roll. Additionally, once per long rest when you roll your Slayer Dice, reroll any 1s.
	- ***Mastery Feature***
		- **Martial Preparation**: You’ve become an inspirational warrior to all who travel with you. Your party gains access to the Martial Preparation downtime move. To use this during a rest, describe how you instruct and train with your party, then give yourself and each ally a Slayer die, which is a d6. Allies can spend your Slayer die to enhance their own weapon Attack or Damage rolls.
- ***==Call of the Brave==*** allows the player to play as a brave Warrior who does not shy from Battle (play [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Classes/Guardian (DH)\|Guardian (DH)]] at this point, in my opinion)
	- ***Foundation Feature***
		- ***Courage***: When you fail a roll with Fear, you gain 1x [[Hope Token\|Hope Token]].
		- ***Battle Ritual:*** Once per long rest, before you attempt something incredibly dangerous or face off against a foe who clearly outmatches you, describe what ritual you perform or preparation you make, then clear 2x [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Stress Point\|Stress Point]] and gain 2x [[Hope Token\|Hope Token]].
	- ***Specialisation Feature***
		- ***Rise to the Challenge:*** You are vigilant in the face of mounting danger. While you have $\leq$ 2 [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/General/Hit Point Slots\|Hit Point Slots]] unmarked, your Hope die becomes a d20.
	- ***Mastery Feature***
		- ***Comaraderie:*** Your unbending courage is a rallying point for your allies. You can initiate a Tag Team Roll one extra time per session. Additionally, when an ally initiates a Tag Team Roll with you, they only need to spend 2x [[Hope Token\|Hope Token]] to do so.

### Background Questions
It is optional to answer any of the following background questions to refine or get ideas for your character's backstory. You can also create your own questions. 
- Who taught you to fight, and why did they stay behind when you left home?
- Somebody defeated you in battle years ago and left you to die. Who was it, and how did they betray you?
- What legendary place have you always wanted to visit, and why is it so special?

### Connections
It is optional to ask your fellow players one of the following questions for their character to answer if their character knows/knew you from before the campaign. You are free to create your own questions.
- We knew each other long before this party came together. How?
- What mundane task do you usually help me with off the battlefield?
- What fear am I helping you overcome?
