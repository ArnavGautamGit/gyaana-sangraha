# Ping
> A cross-platform computer/Terminal commmand which repeatedly sends [[ICMP\|ICMP]] request packets to see if the Website responds - in how much time and if there is packet loss.

Used in [[Footprinting\|Footprinting]] to gain minor information such as RTT to the Website among other things.

Matter yet to be studied.
Nothing can be said just yet.
