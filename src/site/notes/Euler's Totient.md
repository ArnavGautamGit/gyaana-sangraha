# Euler's Totient
> *Number of integers that are smaller but [[Co-Prime Numbers\|co-prime]] with the given integer.*

Euler's Totient is often denoted by $\Large \phi_n$.

Since [[Prime Numbers\|Prime Numbers]] have no factors other than 1 and themselves, they are [[Co-Prime Numbers\|co-prime]] with every number other than 1, so the Euler's Totient for a Prime Number "$\large p$" is: $$\Large \phi_n = p-1$$
