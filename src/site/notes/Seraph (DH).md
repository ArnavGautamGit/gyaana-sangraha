# Seraph (DH)
> A [[DH Character Creation#Character Class\|Character Class]] of Divine, Winged Warriors and Healers given a special purpose by their God. They do morally good things such as protecting the weak and helping the innocent. 

It is said to be better to be an ally of the Seraphs instead of a foe.
Optimise your character by prioritising [[Strength\|Strength]].

### Domains
Domains of a class decide the Domain Cards (and abilities) one gets to pick up.
Each class has 2 fixed Domains.
The Seraph's domains are: [[Splendor\|Splendor]] and [[Valor\|Valor]].

### Base Scores
Base [[Evasion Score\|Evasion Score]]: 7
Major Damage Threshold: 8
Severe Damage Threshold: 16

### Class Items
Each Class has a specific item they choose which will be a plot point in the story. They must choose one of the options.
For a Seraph, choose EITHER *"Bundle of Offerings"* OR *"Sigil of your God"*.

### Seraph's Hope
Spend 3x [[Hope Token\|Hope Token]] to either reroll a Prayer Dice or refresh a used Prayer Dice.

### Class Feature - Prayer Dice
***Prayer Dice*** allows the player to roll a number of d4 dice equal to your Spellcast trait at the beginning of each session and store them. The player is allowed to spend one or more of these dice at any time to aid yourself or an ally within Far range. You can use the spent dice’s value to reduce any incoming damage or add to any roll result after the roll. Alternatively, you can exchange the value for that many Hope you can give to any other PC in range. Clear any unused dice at the end of each session.

### Class Foundations (Subclasses)
Spellcasting Trait is [[Strength\|Strength]] for both the subclasses

- ***==Winged Sentinel==*** allows you to play a RPG analogous to a Winged Air Bomber.
	- ***Foundation Feature*** 
		- Character gains the ability of flight. The play may choose to:
			- Spend 1x [[Hope Token\|Hope Token]] to pickup and carry a willing creature which is approximately the size of the Seraph or Smaller.
			- Mark 1x [[Stress Point\|Stress Point]] to add 1d8 additional damage to any enemy on successful attack roll.
	- ***Specialisation Feature***
		- Your supernatural visage strikes awe and fear. While in flight, you have advantage on Presence Rolls, and if that roll is a success with Hope, you can remove a Fear from the GM's Fear Pool instead of gaining Hope.
	- ***Mastery Feature***
		- Increase your Severe Damage Threshold by +4.
		- Foundation Feature Upgrade:  deals 1d12 additional damage instead of 1d8.
- ***==Divine Wielder==*** allows you to play a ground-based fighter with Minor Healing.
	- ***Foundation Features***
		- **Spirit Weapon**: Any Melee Weapon can be thrown and it returns back to the Seraph's Hands. Works in Close Range. Mark a Stress to add another target without rolling again.
		- ***Sparing Touch***: Once per long rest, clear 2x [[Hit Point Slots\|Hit Point Slots]] OR 2x [[Stress Point\|Stress Point]] by spending an action touching 
	- ***Specialisation Feature***
		- **Devout**: Seraph has the option to roll an extra Prayer Dice and discard the score of the lowest one.
		- **Sparing Touch Upgrade**: Sparing Touch can be used now twice per long rest.
	- ***Mastery Feature***
		- When Seraph rolls damage for their Spirit Weapon, for every pair of matching damage dice values, Seraph can roll an additional damage dice. These additional damage dice can’t be used to match and add more dice i.e., this Feature does not scale. For example, if you roll two 5s, add one extra damage dice to your roll whereas if you roll three 5s, add two extra damage dice.
