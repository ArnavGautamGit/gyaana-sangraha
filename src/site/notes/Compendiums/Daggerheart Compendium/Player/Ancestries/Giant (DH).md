# Giant (DH)
> A [[Compendiums/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Ancestries/DH Species Ancestry\|DH Species Ancestry]] of large massive humanoids of great height, longer necks than humans, arms that reach upto these knees & having between one to three eyes.

Giants are unique to [[Compendiums/Daggerheart Compendium/Daggerheart\|Daggerheart]] but they allow you to play everything big from a Cyclops to Hercules and what not. They have arms that go to their knees - providing exceptional reach with any weapon.

Their size when full-grown ranges from $6\frac{1}{2}$ to $8\frac{1}{2}$ feet but is largely dictated by Genetics. Giants are born without eyes and remain sightless for their first year and slowly form their eyes - the formation is fixed at 10 years of age. The one-eyed ones are called "Cyclops".

> [!example] Pretty Small Giant Lore of their History
> Giants are found all over [[Lurov\|Lurov]], but myths say they descended from the Dragonpeaks and were first seen in the city of [[Triton\|Triton]]. The city is rumoured named after the leader of the Giant Tribe. Giants are often paid more in physical jobs than other species since they are in very high demand - especially in Militaries.

On taking Giant, you get the following Ancestry Features:
- ***Endurance***: Gain additional 1x [[Compendiums/Daggerheart Compendium/General/Hit Point Slots\|HP Slot]] at Character Creation
