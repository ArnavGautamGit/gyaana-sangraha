# Barbarian (D&D)
> Incredibly Strong Characters powered by Rage. The source of this Rage may differ based on Subclass or their personal perspective. Some Barbarians personify their Rage as a fierce spirit or revered forebear. Others see it as a connection to the pain and anguish of the world, as an impersonal tangle of wild magic, or as an expression oftheir own deepest self.
> 
> For every Barbarian, their Rage is a power that fuels not just battle prowess, but also uncanny reflexes and heightened senses.
> 
> Barbarians often serve as protectors and leaders in their communities. They charge headlong into danger so those under their protection don't have to. Their courage in the face of danger makes Bar barians perfectly suited for adventure
