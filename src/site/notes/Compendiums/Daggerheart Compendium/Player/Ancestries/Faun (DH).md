# Faun (DH)
> A [[Compendiums/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Ancestries/DH Species Ancestry\|DH Species Ancestry]] of Goat-like humanoids whose facial features range from human to goat-like with a few features which are definitely going to be with them. Fauns always have horns, rectangular pupils, fur and pointy ears. They may have a face that resembles a goat or fairly humanoid.

Fauns are every energetic as kids and they tend to learn to be independent very quickly in life. They start looking more like a goat and as they age - even developing a hump in old age. Their maximum height ranges from 4 feet to $6\frac{1}{2}$ feet tall.

On choosing Faun, you get the following Ancestry Features:
- ***Caprine Leap***: Leap upto Close Range without Agility Roll as if it is normal movement to jump across gaps or vault over obstacles.
- ***Kick***: On a successful melee attack, mark a [[Compendiums/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Stress Point\|Stress Point]] and choose to either kick the enemy away or kick yourself away - adding 2d6 additional damage either way.

Lifespan of an Average Faun: 225 years.

> [!tip] TIP: Wanna play a Goat or a Cow?
> If you want to be more Cow like, choose a [[Compendiums/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Ancestries/Firbolg (DH)\|Firbolg]], these cow-like humanoid creatures are borrowed from the Irish Mythology... at least their name seems borrowed...
