# Act East Policy
> Act East Policy was an upgrade to India's [[Look East Policy\|Look East Policy]]. It was introduced in November 2014 as an upgrade by the BJP government led by then Indian PM Narendra Modi.

It is a diplomatic extension of the [[India's Foreign Policy\|Indian Foreign Policy]] to South East Asia to counter Chinese Influence in South China Sea.

### Improvements
The Act East Policy also includes increasing Security Partnerships like [[QUAD\|QUAD]].
The Policy is not limited to South East Asia, it also includes East Asian Countries like Japan and aims for Economic Integration (not just economic ties) with all of East & South East Asia.

### Proposals & Achievements
[[India-Myanmar-Thailand Trilateral Highway Project\|India-Myanmar-Thailand Trilateral Highway Project]] connecting the capital cities of all three participating [[State (United Nations)\|States]] with the highway starting from New Delhi & terminating at Bangkok.
While the Indian & Thai sides are complete, the coup in Myanmar holds the Myanmar part of the bargain in doubt. It is thought that China has done this through their [[Mininstry of State Security (MSS)\|MSS]] spies.

[[Mumbai-Ahmedabad High Speed Rail (MAHSR)\|Mumbai-Ahmedabad High Speed Rail (MAHSR)]] Project connecting the two Economic Hubs of India with Japanese Bullet Train Technology. The [[E-10 Shinkansen\|E-10 Shinkansen]] will debut simultaneously in India & Japan. It is set to complete by 2030. Japan has agreed to give us the [[E3 Shinkansen\|E3 Shinkansen]] and the [[E5 Shinkansen\|E5 Shinkansen]] Trainsets for free during the testing phase.
