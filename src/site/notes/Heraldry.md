# Heraldry
> Study of [[Heraldic Achievement\|Heraldic Achievements]] and [[Escutcheon\|Escutcheon]] of various organisations or people around the world. Heraldry is now largely limited to Europe - where these Achievements were first seen. There was a very small spike in time when Heraldry became international due to rampant [[European Colonialism\|European Colonialism]].

Heralds were originally like [[Diplomacy\|diplomats]], envoys or messengers who world meet other kings and lords. To better survey and understand who they were dealing with, they began learning the meanings and depictions of their [[Heraldic Achievement\|Heraldic Achievements]] until it eventually became their job as Heralds reached expertise.

### Varying Traditions
Regardless of its origins, Heraldry was first practiced in Europe in the 12th century. It gained popularity in the 13th and 14th century. It came with its own laws as seen in [[Laws of Heraldry\|Laws of Heraldry]]. Even in Europe, the Laws have inconcistencies since Heraldic Traditions saw changes as the practice moved from location to location. For Example: English Heraldry completely differs from the French or Portuguese Heraldry apart from certain basic conventions.

The varying Traditions that I one-day wish to learn about are:
[[Latin Heraldic Traditions\|Latin Heraldic Traditions]] - English, Scottish, Welsh, Irish, Northern French.
[[Iberian Heraldic Traditions\|Iberian Heraldic Traditions]] - Spanish, Portuguese, French
[[Eastern European Heraldic Traditions\|Eastern European Heraldic Traditions]] - Czech, Prussian, Polish etc.

### Heraldry in India
The practice of Heraldry in India was brought in by the British after the [[British Paramountcy\|British Paramountcy]] which encouraged each ruler of any Indian Princely State to have a Heraldic Achievement of their own and by extension, the nobles followed those colonial powers they were a proxy of themselves. Princely States under the British followed English Heraldic Tradition whereas those nobles who were under the Portuguese Empire (Goan/Konkan region) and those nobles under the French Empire (Puducherry) followed Portuguese and French Traditions respectively (if they wanted to splurge on a heraldic achievement anyway).
Due to the fact that Heraldry has Colonial Connotations, since the Indian Independence the practice has been considered a colonial relic and left unregulated.

### Registering Private Coat of Arms
Most countries that have an monarchical system of government (i.e., are run by monarchs) have a heraldic institution or college of arms which will register said arms for civic and monarchic bodies given that they have a culture of heraldry.

If the country is a republic or a monarchy that has no culture of heraldry, there is no guarantee of a coat of arms registration college/institution being present (most republics do not have them), in that case, one can either go to the Office of Chief Herald of Arms of Malta (in Republic of Malta) knowing that he and his office is associated with a few shady activities or go to the [Heraldry of the World (HOTW)](https://www.heraldry-wiki.com/wiki/Heraldry_of_the_world) to register their arms with them. Note that this is an informal registration, there are other ways which include mailing a sealed envelope of your heraldic design to yourself - effectively timestamping the creation of the achievement.

> [!important] IMPORTANT: Format of Registration
> It is stated at HOTW that if the format of registration is not respected, your registration will be rejected automatically. It is hence, imperitive to check and recheck whether you have made any mistake in your application or not.

Even my [[Personal Coat of Arms\|Personal Coat of Arms]] are registered on HOTW.
One has to send an email in prescribed format at: hotwregister@gmail.com
To check the format, visit the [HOTW's Arms Regisration Website](https://www.heraldry-wiki.com/wiki/How_to_submit_a_registration)

If you do register in Republic of Malta then know that although THAT college of arms is not taken seriously in the community of Heralds and among other institutions of Heraldry, it allows you to register your arms in other institutions in Kenya, Canada, Scotland among others that are better respected.
