# Football
> Sport played between two teams (ideally in 11v11) aiming to score more goals than the other by kicking the ball beyond the opposite team's goal line. 

Sometimes, it is noted that due to shortage of players, smaller grounds for play, the teams may play in a 9v9, 7v7 or even smaller format. All these conditions are also coincidentally true for children so they tend to have a "Playing VII" instead of a "Playing XI" for children's teams.
Football teams often organise into entities called as [[Football Clubs\|Football Clubs]].

A special variant of the game has developed due to the tendency of children to play the game on the streets in smaller player formats - called [[Futsal\|Futsal]] but we will not cover it here.

### What are Formations? Why do we need them?
The sport has evolved in the past 100-200 years that formations & tactics require teams to have specialised players and specific number of players in certain roles depending on the formation they are playing and the tactics they are using.

Diamond Formations (i.e., any formation with the term "Diamond" in it) really have more central midfielders who all arrange themselves in a rhombus shape in the middle so they do not need wingers. This is especially true for 4-4-2 Diamond Formation - my favourite football formation.
