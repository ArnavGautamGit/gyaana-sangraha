# Sanskrit Education in India
The person mainly responsible for giving us this wonderful language known as Sanskrit or Samskritam.
The first geek on the planet who developed the first Turing Machine.

Pāṇiṇi (520 BC - 460 BC) was the first person who gave us the shortest path to learning Sanskrit. His in-depth knowledge has been lost to time yet only one of his surviving books - The Ashtādhyāyi (meaning "8 chapters") contains 8 chapters and 4,000 sutras (known as aphorisms) which teach the entirety of Sanskrit Language.

This book brought a revolution since now anyone could learn Sanskrit by memorising 4000 verses and get ready for speaking it fluently.

It contains extensive rules on Sanskrit grammar and linguistics in his great work with the name Ashtādhyāyi. It is because of these rules that Sanskrit is one of the most logical and scientific languages in this world. Such is the Brilliance of Panini that is morphological analysis on how words are formed are more advanced than nineteenth-century linguist and his non compounding analysis still forms the basis of the linguistic theories on compounding of words in the modern Indian languages.


Now, we must realise that Ashtādhyāyi is a very difficult read and that is because it is very very dense since there is a lot of information to be summarised in just 40 pages. 

Important Question that arises: Panini was able to compress all of that into just 40 pages, so how did he do that?

The Answer:
He did that by codifying language itself, all the rules that were present in the Sanskrit grammar were all codified into different codes and then those codes were then presented in a very rhyming language in his book Ashtādhyāyi.

Pāṇiṇi (also spelled Panini) and the existence of a memorial to Panini was also mentioned by the Chinese Traveller - [[Hiuen Tsang\|Hiuen Tsang]] when he visited India.

Before the Vernacular Language Act and English Education Act was brought in specialists to write a report on vernacular language-based education and literacy levels in various presidencies in India.

William Adam wrote a report on Bengal aur Bihar (then spelled as "Behar") In 1834, 1836 and 1838
