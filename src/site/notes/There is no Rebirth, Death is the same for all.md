# There is no Rebirth, Death is the same for all
In the 14th verse of 2nd Book of [[Meditations\|Meditations]],
[[Marcus Aurelius\|Marcus Aurelius]] states the following:

> [!quote] Quote: *Meditations 2:14*
> *"Though you should live 3000 years or as many myriads, yet remember no manever loses any other life than what he lives, nor lives any other than that which he is now losing. The longest and the shortest lives come to one effect. The present moment is the same for all men, and their loss, is equal, for it is clear that what they lose in death is but a fleeting instant of time. No man can lose either the past or future, for how can a man be deprived of something which he has not? These two things are then to be remembered: First, that things ecur in cycles, are the same for everlasting and therefore, it matters nothing whether a man shall contemplate same things for one hundred years, or for two hundred, or for an infinite stretch of time: and, secondly, that he who lives longest and he dies soonest have an equal loss in death. The present moment is all of which either is deprived, since that is all he has. No man can be robbed of that which he has not."*
> 
> ~ Marcus Aurelius

Firstly when Marcus says that a man lives no life before or after the one he is losing, Marcus means to say that there exists no rebirth. What doesn't make sense to me is how things occur in cycles if rebirth does not exist? Maybe the same mistakes or events are repeated over and over.
