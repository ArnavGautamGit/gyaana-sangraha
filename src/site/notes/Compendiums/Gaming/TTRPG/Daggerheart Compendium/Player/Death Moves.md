# Death Moves
At any time when a character marks their last [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/General/Hit Point Slots\|Hit Point Slots]], it is time to perform a Death Move.
There are three possible death moves and choosing among them is completely on the player. 

### Blaze of Glory
Choose 1 final action and talk to your GM when embracing death which is a Critical Success and leaves a legacy of glory as your character accepts their fate. This is a classic in Fantasy that goes like a charm with each setting.

### Avoid Death
Talk to your GM about how the situation worsens as your character falls unconscious. Your character cannot move or act as they are unconscious. They can’t be targeted by an attack, and they return to consciousness when an ally clears 1 or more of their marked [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/General/Hit Point Slots\|Hit Point Slots]] or when the party finishes a long rest. 

After your character falls unconscious, roll your Hope Die. If its value is equal to or under your character’s level, they gain a scar (and permanently mark off a [[Hope Token\|Hope Token]] Slot)

The narrative impact of this scar is up to you. For example, you might now bear a physical scar, a painful memory, or a deep fear. Scars are permanent, but can be healed at the GM's discretion as a downtime project, a reward for a quest focused on healing that scar, or something with similar narrative weight. If you ever cross out your last Hope slot, it’s time to end your character’s journey. Work with the GM to find a fitting way for the party to say goodbye to them at the end of the session, then prepare a new character at the current level of the rest of the party for the next time you play.

### Risk it All
If one feels lucky, they may choose to roll their [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Duality Dice\|Duality Dice]] and depending on which of the two dice roll higher, the character lives or dies. 

If the Hope Die is higher, your character stays on their feet and clears an amount of Hit Points or Stress equal to the value of the Hope Die (divide the Hope Die value between Hit Points and Stress however you’d prefer). 

If the Fear Die is higher, your character crosses through the veil of death. If you critically succeed, your character stays up and clears all Hit Points and Stress.
