# Uranium-233 Reactions
Uranium-233 (or U-233) is a rarer form of Uranium that is rare not because of any other reason other than the Uranium-235 state being easier to achieve than U-233 since naturally, only U-238 is possible.

Most common Reactions using U-233:

1. Uranium-233 absorbs a neutron to give Xenon-141, Strontium-90, 2 free neutrons and energy. $$\Large ^{233}_{92}U \ + \ 
{ #1_0n}
 \ \rightarrow \ ^{141}_{54}Xe + ^{90}_{38}Sr + 2(^1_0n) + Energy$$
2. Uranium-233 absorbs a neutron to give Barium-139, Krypton-94, 3 free neutrons and energy. $$\Large ^{233}_{92}U \ + \ 
{ #1_0n}
 \ \rightarrow \ ^{139}_{56}Ba + ^{90}_{36}Kr + 3(^1_0n) + Energy$$
Note that the first reaction is not the preferred one since Strontium-90 can replace Calcium in human bones. Which makes it EXTREMELY lethal.
