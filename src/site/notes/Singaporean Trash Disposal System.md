# Singaporean Trash Disposal System
Singapore is very close to "Zero Trash" where all the trash from all homes is brought to inceration plants & its burned.
The pollution-ridden toxic fumes are filtered using a multi-layered filtering & the final exhaust is very safe & clean.

The power generated from the thermal inceration of trash (just like any conventional thermal power plant) is converted to electricity and proided to the city.

in the comments of the short, Singaporeans like @stephaniewong75 testified:
> Singaporean here. Yes, we have such waste-to-energy (WTE) plants but i wouldnt say it's "zero trash". Excess incineration ash (and) non-incineratable trash is sent to Semakau landfill. Our one and only landfill (and it's running out of space). Interesting fact: it's green and lush for a landfill. Can't disregard the effort of our govt, so really proud of this initiative!
