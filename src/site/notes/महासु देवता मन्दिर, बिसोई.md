# महासु देवता मन्दिर, बिसोई
A Massive temple in the small town of Bisoi which locals say is about 150 years old or more. It is a temple built entirely from wood - since wood is a great insulator of heat.

The locals who live nearby also told us that the temple was recently renovated with new wood and the architect who did it has experience of building 21 temples!

There are two goats in the temple and people offer the prasad to them many of the times. They are also there if people/locals of the area want to seek permission to move to some other place for long periods of time.
