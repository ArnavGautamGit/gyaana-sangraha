# Logic Gates
> A part of [[Digital Logic\|Digital Logic]], which use the binaries of 0 and 1 to denote high and low signals. The Gates are the Logic Operators which perform their Logic Operations such as [[NOT\|NOT]], [[AND\|AND]], [[OR\|OR]], [[NAND\|NAND]], [[NOR\|NOR]], [[XOR\|XOR]] and [[XNOR\|XNOR]]

So XOR Gate does the XOR operation
Each Gate has its own usecase and NAND and NOR are called the "Universal Logic Gates" since they can be used to create every other Logic Gate.
