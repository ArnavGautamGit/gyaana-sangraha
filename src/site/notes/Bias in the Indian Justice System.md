# Bias of the Indian Courts
> This note address the biases of the Courts in India (including the Hon'ble [[Supreme Court of India\|Supreme Court]]) and also wants to bring to light the problems with the [[Indian Judiciary\|Indian Judicial System]].

Here are some cases which showcase the bias of Indian Courts.
Enjoy reading.

## Yakub Menon's Hanging (2015)
in 2015, the Supreme Court opened at 3 AM once for the review of the death sentence of the infamous Kashmiri secessionist & terrorist, Yakub Menon but when the evidences piled up against Menon, they couldn't do jack shit. They had to reject Yakub Menon's plea. The petition was heard by a three-judge bench in court number 4 of the Supreme Court after security checks. The Supreme Court has never before been opened at 3 AM for a hearing!

### Delhi Liquor Policy Case (2022-24)
In 2024, on March 21 when Delhi's serving CM Arvind Kejriwal was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) after Mr. Kejriwal had IGNORED Enforcement Directorate's 9 summons and they were interrogating him in their Headquarters. Abhishek Manu Singhvi, Kejriwal's lawyer went to the Supreme Court at 10:20 AM to claim and (hopefully) prove that the arrest is driven by politics and political vendetta. The ED which planned that they would properly interrogate the suspect and then bring him to Court by 2:30pm to 3:30pm of March 22. The "Honourable" Chief Justice [[DY Chandrachud\|DY Chandrachud]] granted Abhishek Manu Singhvi's request within 15 minutes and Court Hall number 2 was assigned to be used for the hearing in the case!

Why is the "Honourable" Supreme Court trying to shelter a politician who is drenched in corruption, when half of his cabinet Delhi's Deputy CM is in jail for various corruption cases? These people were brewing a scam in the middle of the National Capital - The Delhi Liquor Policy Scam! If the Policy was not a scam then why did they suilently repeal the policy when it leaked into the media?

Later the Courts let Kejriwal go! It was done on the pretext of letting the people of the country decide whether he was guilty by the power of their vote... please tell me which article of the [[Constitution of India\|Constitution of India]] allows this and why was Kejriwal not put under trial again after he lost the Delhi Assembly Polls in 2025?

### Fake Rape Cases and Marital Rape
There's a concept of "burden of proof", which has been set on the man, and not the accusing woman.
In any case, the person accusing or the police should have to prove that the crime (rape) happened. But in case of rape, the man has to prove that there was consent.
- And how to prove it?
- Can you record the consent or the act as proof? No, it will be a crime in itself.
- Can you both sign a document with your consents? You can, but it will have 0 legal value since the girl can claim she was forced to sign.

So essentially, a girl can just say "rape" after having sex with consent, and if no clear evidences are available, the guy is going to be in trouble.

According to the NCBI data, 74% of rape cases are false. Imagine the can of worms Feminazis are trying to open when with marital rape, any woman can get up and say "rape" in the police station to get the husband and the entire family in the jail until they are taken to a magistrate in the next 24 hours and even then how would you prove consent? It takes ages in the Indian Courts to prove a case, hearings are far apart and the result of the case is announced 100s of hearings later. Many people lose their jobs as soon as they are accused. What about that?

***Bigger Question**: Doesn't matter if you win or lose the case what is your respect in society now? The same respect and reputation that took you and your family generations to build is now gone in 24 hours....*

Not to mention, if the woman drugs the man or forces the man to have sex with her then that is considered as rape in other countries, but not in India - since here only men can rape or sexually harass? That isn't sexist? Sure is!

I am firmly against Marital Rape becoming legal not because I wish to take away the rights of women but I fear many women who already misuse the current laws will go crazy with this one UNLESS the laws are made Gender-Neutral.

### The God Complex of Indian Courts
The judges have a lot of fun when they see a person is not in the exact uniform and has made even the slightest mistake, the judges are going to make the said person the subject of an angry verbal assault and ridicule for 20-30 minutes.

Indian Courts (according to 2022 calendar) took ***42 day Summer Vacations*** (excluding Sundays), ***6 days each for Diwali and Dussehra Vacations*** (where they ban crackers, so why take vacations when you won't celebrate and won't want others to celebrate either?) then we see ***12 days of Winter Vacations*** (excluding Sundays), ***14 Festival Holidays and 52 Sundays***. Best part is that ***even on Saturdays, only exceptional cases are listed*** i.e., courts do not function like they do normally - ***==which means that for the entire duration of the year, Our Beloved High Court and Supreme Court "Lords" work for only 183 days! My School had more working days than this!== Courts start at 10:30 and end at 4:30 which means that ==Daily Working of 5 hours only!==*** 

There are 8.7 Crore (87 Million) pending cases in the Courts right now - out of which around 70,000 are pending in the courts of our Hon'ble Supreme Court... classic example of marshalling other houses when your own house is out of order!
