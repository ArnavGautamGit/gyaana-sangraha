# Reasons why Millennials love to hate Gen Z
Everyone knows about the racist or unhinged grandparent that absolutely destroys everyone's mood and no one wants to invite them to festivities?. 

Yeah. The Millennials must realise that in the next 25-30 years, it will be Gen Z who would be controlling the world and they'd be the grandparent who no one wants to invite to dinner. They became the very thing that they swore to destroy and now they want to pin the blame on some external factor that forced them to become like this... they conveniently pin it on the Gen Z as a scapegoat. 

Most of them are salty we can use the tech they created better than them. We are the faster to adapt to any new technology that is introduced in the market. While they are busy fearing AI becoming this or that in the future, we are already using AI to do homework and tests - that's not being lazy, that's being smart.

Using their own logic on themselves, the Millennials are basically freeloaders of the tech that was built by GenX and the previous generations. They did not create the Routers, Ethernet (LAN Cables) or even the Intenet (since it was a thing already being tested during the Cold War by Intelligence Agencies)
They just commercialised all the products (websites) they made out of GenX tech.
They just made the dotcom bubble and looted the investor's money!

They think we do not know about Vinyls, Casettes and Film Photography but the reason these "retro" gadgets are making a comeback is because of us.
