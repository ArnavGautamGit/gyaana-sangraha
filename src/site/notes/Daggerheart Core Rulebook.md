# Daggerheart Core Rulebook
> The first and foundational Rulebook of how to play [[Compendiums/Daggerheart Compendium/Daggerheart\|Daggerheart]] released in May 2025. I had pre-ordered its first edition in April 2025.

Unlike many games like [[Compendiums/D&D Compendium/Dungeons & Dragons\|D&D]] and [[Pathfinder 2e\|Pathfinder 2e]], there is only ONE rulebook required to play the game of [[Compendiums/Daggerheart Compendium/Daggerheart\|Daggerheart]] with your friends (we do not talk about how the actual size of 1 book is roughly the same as all the 3 rulebooks of D&D combined)

There is also some post-release Open-Beta Content being released on their Website known as The Void.

### Rules Summary
In Daggerheart, a pair of d12 dice are used - known as the [[Compendiums/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Duality Dice\|Duality Dice]].
The Character Creation Process is described in [[Compendiums/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/DH Character Creation\|DH Character Creation]].
If you want to Multi-class, check the [[Compendiums/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/DH Multiclassing Rules\|DH Multiclassing Rules]]
The Combat is decribed in [[Compendiums/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/DH Combat Rules\|DH Combat Rules]].
There are specific rules for Character Death (see [[Compendiums/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Death Moves\|Death Moves]]).
There are also no shortage of mechanics for [[Compendiums/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/DH Character Rest Rules\|DH Character Rest Rules]].

The "[[Compendiums/Daggerheart Compendium/General/Spotlight & GM Move\|Spotlight & GM Move]]" are special Daggerheart Mechanics that I have not seen anywhere else. It is named so since it is a way to showcase the same kind of shift in the spotlight as it is in theatre.

Checking if a player's attack hits an adversary or not is checked via the [[Compendiums/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Duality Dice\|Duality Dice]] instead of the classic d20, there are other concepts like [[Compendiums/Daggerheart Compendium/General/Hit Point Slots\|Hit Point Slots]] which are fixed for each character (unless increased by taking a specific Class or Foundation) while the characters can spend or mark off [[Compendiums/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Armour Slots\|Armour Slots]] (only 1 per attack unless a specific feature allows more than 1) to avoid taking as much damage to their Hit Points and possibly dying. 

Advantage and Disadvantage is marked using a d6 dice rolled along with the 2d12, the result of the d6 dice is added to [[Compendiums/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Duality Dice\|Duality Dice]] for advantage and subtracted from the same for disadvantage.

1x [[Hope Token\|Hope Token]] can be spent by any character to give another character apart from themselves an advantage on their rolls. 
Whereas any pair of characters can choose to strike off 3x [[Hope Token\|Hope Token]] each to team up & attack together at the same time.
