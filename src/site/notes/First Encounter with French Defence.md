# First Encounter with French Defence
On 17th July 2025, I believe it to be the first ever time when I actually encountered French Defence to be played against me when I was playing with the white pieces.

The Encounter itself was so short, it could have been a misclick on Black's end where they played e6 intead of e5. I would like to apologise to those looking at this on the website since it won't look good.
