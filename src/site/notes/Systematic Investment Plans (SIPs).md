# Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs)
> Systematic plans to invest a part of your monthly/quarterly income consistently in [[Mutual Funds\|Mutual Funds]] and get a good access to [[Net Asset Value (NAV)\|NAV]] units without trying to time your entry.

A new number of maximum possible units fro the price are bought on the same date of each month i.e., if the first batch of NAV units was bought on 7th January, the next batch will be bought on 7th February and 7th March and so on.

SIPs are the best way of building discipline for people with fixed income and the only option for those who do not have a big enough amount for Lumpsum lying around.

*Divide 128 by the number of years you want to double your money in to figure out how much CAGR (Cumulative Annual Growth Rate) you need for the goal.*
