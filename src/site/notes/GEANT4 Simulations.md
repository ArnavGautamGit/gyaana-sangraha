# GEANT4 Simulations
GEANT4 uses [[Monte Carlo Simulations\|Monte Carlo Simulations]] in the domain of particle physics. It sees many usecase outside of physics where particle interactions are paramount like Cancer Treatmeants through [[chemotherapy\|chemotherapy]].

GEANT4 simulations are coded with [[C++\|C++]] i.e., any visualisation software such as [[ROOT\|ROOT]] that just visualise the GEANT4 code, do not need to be coded separately and use the same C++ code.
