| 1.   | Definition               | A Worm is a form of malware that replicates itself and can spread to different computers via Network.                                                                                                                                                       | A Virus is a malicious executable code attached to another executable file which can be harmless or can modify or delete data.                                                                                                                     |
| 2.   | Objective                | The main objective of worms is to eat the system resources.
