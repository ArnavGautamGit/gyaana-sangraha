# Indian Vedic Period
> A time period in [[Indian History\|Indian History]] when [[Hinduism\|Hinduism]] was being governed by the [[Vedic Literature\|Vedic Literature]] only since other texts had not been written.

Popularly believed to have reached its peak from 1500 to 600 BC, it was a time period when the people had started living rural lives again like the [[Chalcolithic Period\|Chalcolithic Period]] before [[Indus Valley Civilsation\|Indus Valley Civilsation]] came to be. These rural settlements organised themselves as each Jana (Person) having some access to Janapadas (Lands of People). These Janapadas combined together as one of the many Mahajanpada.

Vedic Period can be divided into Early Vedic Period and Late Vedic Period dependent upon the discovery of Iron on the Indian subcontinent in 1000 BC with the oldest sample at Atranjikhera & Hastinapur where bronze from [[Chalcolithic Period\|Chalcolithic Period]] was also found.

There is a big chance these rural settlements or Janapadas co-existed with the urbanised centres in the Indus-Saraswati basin like [[Indus Valley Civilsation\|Indus Valley Civilsation]] as their rural agrarian backbone similar to how Delhi, Noida, Gurugram, Meerut is a belt of a few urbanised cities in a mostly-agrarian [[Ganga-Brahmaputra-Barak River System\|Ganga-Yamuna]] basin and there are no major cities until we reach Agra & Kanpur.

### Culture & Society
We know that the people of the town were known as "Jana" (जन) meaning people while the leader elected by the Political Bodies of Samiti was called "Rājana" (राजन) which eventually shortened to "Raja" eventually. The Rājana (also spelled Rajan or Rājan) was aided by a Purohit (Brahmin Priest) and advised by three councils - Sabha, Samiti and Vidat.

We know women held a good place in Vedic Society in the Early Vedic Phase as we see evidence of women being well-read and also being a part of composing Vedic Hymns in praise of Vedic Gods such as Indra, Agni, Mitra, Varuna, Māruta, Som among other divine beings like Usha and Aditi. These women were known as "Rishika" while the males who composed Vedic Hymns were "Rishi". Popularly known Rishikas who contributed to [[Vedic Literature\|Vedic Literature]] often include Lopamudra.

They conducted elaborate fire altar rituals known as Yajnas that are still a part of [[Hinduism\|Hinduism]] today as it is along with shorter rituals from the [[Purāṇa\|Purāṇas]] known as Homa/Havan. Women then (and even today) are still allowed to conduct & participate in Yajnas. Yajnas were purely for material benefit before the works of [[Upānishads\|Upānishads]] became popular.

Chariot Races called "Vajpeh" were conducted and often if the Rājan was participating, he was intentionally made to win in the end to maintain his respect and new Rājan was always coronated in the Yajna called "Rajsveha".

### Politics & Warfare
There were three major political bodies in the Vedic Culture - Sabha, Samiti & Vidat. 
Sabha looked after the public administration while Vidat looked after the finances & taxation.
Among these, only the Samiti held the power to elect the Rājan and it was the only council NOT to have women in it since the Rājan needs to lead the people even in wars - only the people with experience of administration & war were allowed into the Samiti. 

Wars (also called Gavishti Wars) were fought for Cattle, not land or people or revenue. Cattle was the prime source of revenue since cows/buffalos can provide milk and bulls are used in agriculture for ploughing.

### Taxation
Voluntary Tax called "Bali" (i.e., "Sacrifice") was the tradition, although later certain Mahajanpadas began charging "Bhāg" meaning "Share" which was compulsory share of 1/4 or 1/25 of total produce.

### Changes in Society after 1000 BC
Eventually in time, Rājan's position becomes hereditary and the councils would only implement Rājan's policies instead of proposing & voting on proposals of new policies. Financial Matters were moved to be under the jursidiction of Sabha as the Vidat council was done away with.

Wars came to be fought for Janapada (Land) instead of cattle and grains as a result wars got brutal & women were then being protected more fiercely which soon became the early precursor of patriarchal society of the medieval era. Not that I care about Feminism anyway.

This is also the era where the 108 [[Upānishads\|Upanishads]] were written & provided a purely spiritual interpretation of the knowledge of each [[Veda Samhita\|Veda Samhita]] it is affiliated to. These Upanishads were written in the form of dialogue between guru and disciple. Before Upanishads, there were the [[Aranyaka\|Aranyaka]] texts which were partially spiritual and partially material. [[Brāhmaṇa\|Brāhmaṇa]] texts offer purely orthodox point of view from the perspective of daily rituals & Yajnas.
