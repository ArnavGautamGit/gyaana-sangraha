# D&D Damage & Healing Rules
> Rules regarding injury and death are frequent threats in [[Compendiums/D&D Compendium/Dungeons & Dragons\|D&D]], as detailed in the following notes.

We cover Hit Points, Damage Rolls, Critical Rolls among other things.
Firstly, we would go for Hit Points and Damage Rolls.

### Hit Points (HP)
Hit Points represent durability, health and the will to live. Creatures with more Hit Points are more difficult to kill. Your Hit Point maximum is the number of Hit Points you have when uninjured. Your current Hit Points can be any number from that maximum down to 0, which is the lowest Hit Points can go.

***Whenever you take damage, subtract it from your Hit Points.*** Hit Point loss has no effect on your capabilities until you reach 0 Hit Points.

***Whenever your hitpoints hit zero, characters can die in certain conditions*** like when the Hit Point Maximum hits zero due to life-draining effects like curses or spells among other things like special poisons. ***If incoming damage pushes your hit points below zero*** your character will only go [[D&D Conditions\|Unconscious]] unless there is still damage remaining after your HP is zero & the remainder equals or exceeds their Hit Point maximum. For example, if your character has a max HP of 12, currently has 6 HP, and takes 18 damage, the character drops to 0 Hit Points, but 12 damage remains. The character then dies, since 12 equals their Hit Point maximum. If they had taken 17 damage instead of 18 - they would have lived.

### Damage Rolls
After your attack roll's output (D20 + Advantage/Disadvantage + Modifier) has rolled higher than the target's [[Armour Class (AC)\|Armour Class (AC)]], you can now check your weapon's damage dice and roll those dice, add your ability modifiers (for example: Strength for Axes, also mentioned on weapons) and deal that much damage to the target.

If there's a penalty to the damage, it's possible to deal 0 damage but not negative damage.
When attacking with a weapon, you add your ability modifier-the same modifier used for the attack roll -to the damage roll. A spell tells you which dice to roll for damage and whether to add any modifiers. Unless a rule says otherwise, you don't add your ability modifier to a fixed damage amount that doesn't use a roll, such as the damage of a Blowgun. For Weapon Damage Dice check chapter 6, for spell damage dice see Chapter 7 of the physical/PDF version of the [[Compendiums/D&D Compendium/Corebooks/D&D Player's Handbook\|D&D Player's Handbook]].

### Critical Hits
Critical Hits are rolling a Natural 20 (raw 20 on your d20 roll before adding any modifiers) on an Attack Roll to check if your attack hits. It is called a Critical Roll when the Nat 20 occurs on any other [[D&D d20 Tests\|D20 test]] outside of combat.

On a Critical Hit, you are suppose to roll the attack's damage dice twice, add them together and add any relevant modifiers as normal. Basically, you roll double the original number of damage dice & add your modifiers like before - doesn't matter if the attack is from a weapon, spell, feat or any other ability.

### Damage from Saving Throws
If the Saving Throw is needed from multiple targets then the damage must be rolled ONCE which will apply for all targets. It would be very weird if a Wizard casts Fireball and it does different damage to different targets hit by the same spell even though they were standing next to each other. 
Some Saving Throws may result in half-damage even if the target succeeds, remember to round DOWN if encountering a decimal.

### Damage Resistance or Vulnerability
Some creatures and objects have Resistance or Vulnerability to certain [[D&D Damage Types\|Damage Types]]. If you have Resistance to a damage type, damage of that type is halved against you (round down). If you have Vulnerability to a damage type, damage of that type is doubled against you.

Although you can have resistance to a multiple damage types along with resistance to all damage but it does not mean that you can stack them. For Example: if you have resistance to fire and all damage, you can only reduce the damage by half ONCE even if you are taking Fire Damage (which suffices both conditions).

Modifiers to damage are applied in the following order: adjustments such as bonuses, penalties, or multipliers are applied first; Resistance is applied second; and Vulnerability is applied third. For example: a creature has Resistance to all damage and Vulnerability to Fire damage, and it's within a magical aura that reduces all damage by 5. If it takes 28 Fire damage, the damage is first reduced by 5 (to 23), then halved for the creature's Resistance (and rounded down to 11), then doubled for its Vulnerability (to 22).

### Immunity
It is a stronger form of resistance, where Immunity to a damage type means you don't take damage of that type, and Immunity to any [[D&D Conditions\|Condition]] means you aren't affected by it.

### Healing
Hit Points can be restored by magic, such as the *Cure Wounds* spell or a *Potion of Healing*, or by a Short or Long Rest. When you receive healing, add the restored Hit Points to your current Hit Points. Your Hit Points can't exceed your Hit Point maximum, so any Hit Points regained in excess of the maximum are lost. For example, if you receive 8 Hit Points of healing and have 14 Hit Points and a Hit Point maximum of 20, you regain 6 Hit Points, not 8

> [!tip] Tip: Resting is the fastest, cheapest & easiest way to Heal
> Characters need rest so that they can heal and let off some stress which is important to be at the prime condition for the next threat may be looming around any corner and players must be prepared, healed and free of physical or mental stress (although Stress in this game is not measured or used like [[Compendiums/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Stress Point\|Stress in Daggerheart]])
> Any creature can take 1-hour Short Rests in the midst of a day and an 8-hour Long Rest at the end of day.

### Temporary Hit Points (Temp HP)
Some spells and other effects confer Temporary Hit Points, which are a buffer against losing actual Hit Points since Temporary HP is taken off first when taking damage. 
They do not stack on top of each other like actual HP. On receiving a new set of Temp HP on top of your old one - you have to choose which you want to keep. You cannot add them both.

Healing does not restore Temp HP and receiving Temp HP is not healing.
If a PC is unconscious, using Temporary HP cannot bring them back to consciousness. Only true healing saves them.
