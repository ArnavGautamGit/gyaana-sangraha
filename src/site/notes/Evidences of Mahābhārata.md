# Evidences of Mahābhārata
The Mahābhārata (महाभारत) is the largest [[Itihāsa\|Itihāsa]] text written by Shri [[Veda Vyāsa\|Veda Vyāsa]]
Many people call Mahābhārata a myth. But I have compiled an evidence based on multiple different forms.

### Literary Evidences for dating the epic
According to Puranic Stories, Krishna's return to Vaikuntha marked the ending of Dvāpara Yuga and the start of Kali Yuga.

The Kali Yuga - according to the [[Sūrya Siddhānta\|Sūrya Siddhānta]], started at 2:27:30 AM, 18th February 3102 BCE. This calculation is written at *"Shree Krishna Neejdham Prasthan Teerth"*. According to Aryabhatta's *"Aryabhattiyam"* where he wrote in it that he is writing the book in the year 3600 of Kali Yuga, the book was written in 499 CE.

$\large 3600-499+1=3102$ (we add the extra 1 to account for the year from 1 BCE to 1 CE)
