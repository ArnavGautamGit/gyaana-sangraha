# Reactance
> A phenomenon which states: "when we are deprived of something we find it more attractive"

A special branch of [[Scarcity Error\|Scarcity Error]] which is also called as the "Romeo & Juliet Effect" since it was also a kind of love that they were explicitly forbidden & kept away from.

This is the basis of Rebel Nature in Society. People with more Reactance tend to be rebels. Teen parties often have alcoholic drinks since they are forbidden for a few years to drink & they cannot resist the urge.
