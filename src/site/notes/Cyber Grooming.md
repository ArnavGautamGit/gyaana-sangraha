# Cyber Grooming
> The Process involving an adult attracting minors by making a Social Media account posing as a minor and enticing the target possibly or exual or idealogical favours. 

There are many Grooming-Gangs in the UK ran by Pakistani Punjabis which entice young girls (minors) for sexual favours when the grown men pose as teens of a similar age.

### Handling & Reporting
If you suspect that the person on the other end of an internet conversation is not actually your age and possibly grooming you, the best approach is to stop answering any texts or calls from the suspect - take screenshots of the conversation & get them printed in a hard copy form so that they are prepared for being submitted to your parent (or Guardian) and if needed then also to the Police.

### Prevention
1. Keep your Social Media Accounts on "Private".
2. Do not upload personal or private information on Social Media
3. Do not accept follow or connection requests from strangers on Social Media.
