# Hedonic Treadmill
> Any person no matter how much grief or delight they are going through would eventually come back to their normal state. 
> Named after how on a Treadmill, the user may *run fast* or *go slow* but eventually return to the normal speed due to fatigue or boredom respectively.

Hedonic Treadmill does not mean a person whose natural state is slightly depressing than average cannot become a cheerful person - but it is a very slow process of slowly raising the average/normal state upwards.
