# Blu-Ray Discs
> A format for discs to allow for storing data of 25 GB on single-layered discs & 50 GB on the dual-layered disc versions.

Blu-Ray discs (also spelled "Bluray Discs" or "BDs") are most popularly used for selling the physical disc versions of [[Video Games\|Video Games]], [[Movies & TV Shows\|Movies & TV Shows]]. Since unlike games, movies also have a theatrical run, the movie blu-rays are called "Home-Video versions". 

### Sub-Formats and Adoptability
The maximum quality movies that could fit on a 25 GB disc with multiple audio tracks of 5-channel audio or even 7-channel audio is 1920x1080 pixels - which is also called "Full HD" or "2K" format. 

With the release of the movie - Avatar (2009) by James Cameroon, the movie grossed the most money that any movie had grossed and especially so on 3D. It was not long before a specific ***Blu-Ray 3D*** format was launched although due to how many extra things such as 3D capable TVs, high speed HDMI cable and specific 3D players being needed, the format never really hit the masses.

Nowadays the newest is the 4K format or the 4K blu-ray which allows for 4K UHD viewing (owing to better discs which can store 100 GBs) but I do not personally feel that the resolution jump is big enough to justify a price which is 4 times that of a 2K Disc. Not to mention one would need a 4K player and 4K capable TV - which is expensive and not worth it unless the TV is massive in size (doubly-expensive).

As [[Video Games\|Video Games]] got bigger, we have a space shortage if the blu-ray is not configured properly, most single-player games can fit in 25-100 GBs and can hence Blu-ray as a format in gaming reached mass adoption. Not to mention, since Sony owns the Blu-ray format all their gaming consoles, ***==the PS3/PS4 can support DVD, Standard Blu-ray, Blu-Ray 3D==*** while the ***==PS5 can support Standard Blu-Ray and 4K UHD.==*** Even Xbox supports quite a few Blu-ray formats but no one recommends them since Sony does it better.

### Region Coding
The world is divided into 3 regions: 
Region A (Americas and Japan)
Region B (Europe, Oceania & Africa)
Region C (Asia except Japan)

For any player or gaming console (like PS3/PS4/PS5) one would need a disc encoded as Region C or Region ABC (all-regions or region-free).

Every Disc would say the region using the alphabets with each alphabet in its own hexagon. If the disc has more than 1 region, the two hexagons will be placed together horizontally, joined over a common edge. If all three regions are present, then the three hexagons are arranged as a triangle.

> [!tip] TIP: If you have a 4K player...
> Although the provision for region-coding 4K blu-ray exists and is the same as described in this section (A, B, C) even then the 4K format discs are never encoded in regions because nowadays blu-rays are released after the entire theatrical run is over. 
> 
> Also 4K format for any movie before 2016 is stupid and unneccessary.
