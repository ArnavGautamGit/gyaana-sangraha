# Ren'Py - Game Engine
Ren'Py is a game engine based on [[Python\|Python]] which allows you to build Visual Novel-esque games very similar to "Doki Doki Literature Club" or "Choices: Stories you play" & the games can be made cross-platform and easily be ported to mobile! (Although people would not pay for Mobile versions since they have alternates available for free)

Some people in the community do not think Visual Novels are games & while I truly see the point that the user is not interacting or playing the game, but rather just reading is not really a game but a slideshow anime with no voice actors - just text.

On the flip side, it is the only way to make games for cheap in the market when you do not have a particular skill.
