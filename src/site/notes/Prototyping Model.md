# Prototyping Model
> An [[Evolutionary Software Models\|Evolutionary Software Model]] built to make Feasibility Test easier and help companies decide which of the proposed software products have the best business opportunity and the biggest [[Total Addressable Market (TAM)\|Total Addressable Market (TAM)]]

Prototyping is great for situations where the company wants to feasibility test a product idea by building a [[Minimum Viable Product (MVP)\|Minimum Viable Product (MVP)]]. It is also of great use when the developers already know (or have an idea of) the basic features to be added and some surface level details of the product

### Working & Process
Developers first communicate with the stakeholders about whether their idea about the product is correct or if they are missing something. Then the features to be included in the prototype are planned. Prototype is implemented on the basis of this planning and showcased to the stakholders for improvements.

The stakeholders suggest changes and improvements in the product. The model follows a similar process to [[Build & Fix Model\|Build & Fix Model]] after this but unlike Build & Fix, the prototype is only deployed AFTER it has evolved into a complete product.

### Weaknesses
1. It gives a chance to the stakeholders to bicker and interfere too much in the development process.
2. Developers are prone to make hasty decisions without worrying about the OS, Programming Languages's properties like Speed among other things.
3. Managers and Clients can force the developers to slap "few fixes" on the hasty decisions of the prototype.
4. There is a lack of documentation in the project development process due to the erratic nature of prototyping (compared to other structured methods)
5. In case there is a change in developer staff, the new joinees do not know anything since there is a lack of documentation on the project.
