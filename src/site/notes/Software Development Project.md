# Software Development Project
> Software Development Projects or Software Projects is defined as the entire process of ideation, [[Software Design\|design]], development, [[Software Testing\|testing]] and [[Software Deployment\|deployment]] of a software solution to a problem which may or may not be requested by a client or stakeholder.

Projects are always broken into multiple smaller tasks (called Activities) to help track progress and accountability which is why we can also define a project as a set of ordered tasks that lead to the fulfilment of one of the steps in the [[Software Development Life Cycle\|Software Development Life Cycle]] depending upon which one of the [[SDLC Models\|SDLC Models]] the developers chose.

These Activities are generally dependent on each other i.e., one could not be started before completing another and are tracked by using either Tabular or Graphical Representations (called as an [[Activity Network Diagram (AND)\|Activity Network Diagram (AND)]]). 
Often times, software development companies use both tables and ANDs.

Some companies may measure Duration in Days, some in weeks. Some may also have an extra column named "date" so we can account for Weekends. Also note that in a tabular representation, the dependencies column is not always filled since not every task is dependent upon another task, if you see an empty cell for dependencies, then it is perfectly fine to be reassured that there is no such dependency.

There is also a term known as a milestone! It takes 0 days (on a graph/an [[Activity Network Diagram (AND)\|AND]]) after the task achievement. It is written as M in the bracket of a dependency. Example Table is given below.

| Activity | Duration | Dependencies |
| -------- | -------- | ------------ |
| T1       | 8        |              |
| T2       | 15       |              |
| T3       | 15       | T1 (M1)      |
ANDs maybe harder to read than Tables due to dummies.
