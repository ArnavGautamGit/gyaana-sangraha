# Liking Bias
> The tendency to prefer something over other options because you like the preferred thing - even if it is subconsciously known that other options are better than the chosen/preferred option.

The intensity of bias scales with the intensity of liking the preferred thing i.e., the more you like it, the more you prefer it.

### Lessons Learnt
- If you want the other person/people to like you - mirror their movements with very slight variation, agree to their viewpoint (add to the conversation and help reinforce their liking by giving reasonings to justify their preference instead of just nodding if you want to make it look realistic)
- Conversation NGOs only choose cuter animals like Pandas and Koalas even though certain species of Spiders and Bacteria are just as endangered.

### Avoidance
If you are being pitched something, judge the product independent of the people pitching it. Pretend you don't like the person/people pitching the deal to you if that helps in disconnecting the product from the salesperson.
