# Pareto Principle
> A scientific principle used in Psychology which states 80% of the results come from 20% of the factors. 

This refers to the fact that it should be our goal to identify these 20% factors and increase the utilisation percentage of these factors in my productivity system. (Assuming the "result" is positive.)

Utilise more of what works and less of what did not have much of an outcome.

Vet any advice through the Logical Brain.
Sort the new advice by trying it first and then reviewing if the added factors produced any increment in results, if not then discard them.
