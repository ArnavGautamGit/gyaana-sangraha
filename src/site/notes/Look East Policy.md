# Look East Policy
> Look East Policy was a part of the [[India's Foreign Policy\|Indian Foreign Policy]] since 1992 when then Indian Prime Minister PV Narsimha Rao introduced & enacted it

It was an important policy since it had been almost 25 years since the formation of the [[Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN)\|Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN)]] when the policy was announced. The closest member of ASEAN to India geographically was Myanmar.

Within 25 years many [[State (United Nations)\|Member States]] started reaping its benefits & India due to her close proximity with many of its members wanted to take part in the said progress while adding to the growth stories of both sides. 

The Policy was focused on extending a diplomatic hand of friendship to extend India's diplomatic presence from the Indian Subcontinent to all of Indo-Pacific region. 

### Achievements
Under this policy, India became a dialogue partner of ASEAN in 1996 and a Summit-Level Partner in 2002. 

India signed a Free Trade Agreement with ASEAN in 2010.
India's trade with ASEAN jumped from 2 Billion USD (pre-agreement) to almost the double by the time the BJP government came to power.

In 2012, the partnership was upgraded into Strategic Partnership.
