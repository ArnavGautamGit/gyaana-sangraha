# Payload
> An Item or collection of Items of defined dimension & weight limits that needs to be carried by a vehicle & may or may not be delivered to a specific location.

This term is often used in Aviation (Aeronautics) and Aerospace. Seldom also in the process of Designing Fighter Jets & [[UAV Design\|Designing UAVs]].

## Classification of Payload
Payloads can be classified on the basis of either function, storage location or weight.
Functional Classifications help in [[Payload Design\|Payload Design]] by telling us the way the payload needs to be handled while Weight Classifications help us define the carrying capacity & affect on the range of the vehicle.

### Classification by Function
Function of a Payload may be surveillance, cargo shipment or it may be droppable/throwable.
While this classification is used less often, it is equally important since the function defines the [[Payload Design\|Payload Design]] & how the payload needs to be treated. 
Surveillance payload may include Cameras and RADARs which need to be treated differently than Cargo & Shipment based payloads which may stay onboard or be dropped

### Classification by Storage Location
Payloads are often calssified by Storage Location such as onboard and deliverables. 
Onboard Payload is defined as equipment or payloads that stay on the vehicle the entire flight duration (such as RADARs, Guidance & Surveillance Cameras) whereas Deliverables are those which need to be dropped or thrown from above.

Among Onboard Payloads, those payloads which are stored in an Internal Bay are referred to as "Internal Onboard Payloads". Wheras the payloads stored on [[Aircraft Pylons\|Aircraft Pylons]] are referred to as "External Onboard Payloads".

### Classification by Weight
Weight Classifications are generally used to define how heavy of a payload a specific vehicle can carry, since the maximum range of any vehicle will get reduced when a payload is added, the weight range which puts little affect to maximum range is termed as "light" payload. On the other end, any payload weight range that marks a sizable decrease in maximum range is called as a "heavy" payload with everything in between being considered as "moderate".

It is to be noted that while definitions of "heavy", "moderate" and "light" weight changes dependent on how much change in range is considered sizable enough to warrant the labels, the important factor is often the Maximum Payload Capacity of any vehicle carrying said payload & if the desired payload fits the vehicle.
