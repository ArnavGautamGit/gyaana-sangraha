# Polymorphism (Programming)
> Ability of objects to take multiple forms depending upon context.

Polymorphism in the programming world is used in two contexts, one of using Polymorphism and using its contect to explain the behaviour of [[Types of Computer Viruses#3. Polymorphic Virus\|Polymorphic Viruses]] and the other being in the subject of [[Object Oriented Programming\|Object Oriented Programming (OOP)]]

For this note, we cover Polymorphism as seen in OOP only.

Best example of Polymorphism in OOP is [[Overloading & Overriding#Constructor Overloading\|Constructor Overloading]].

Polymorphism can be subdivided on the basis of when it occurs in the code's running cycle.
It can also be described as whether the Polymorphism is Static or Dynamic.
1. ***Compile-Time:*** [[Overloading & Overriding#Constructor Overloading\|Constructor Overloading]], [[Overloading & Overriding#Function Overloading\|Function Overloading]], [[Overloading & Overriding#Operator Overloading\|Operator Overloading]]
2. ***Run-Time (Dynamic):*** [[Overloading & Overriding#Function Overriding\|Function Overriding]].
