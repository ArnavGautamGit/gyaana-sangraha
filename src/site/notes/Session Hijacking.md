# Session Hijacking
Before we understand what Session Hijacking is, we must understand what a session is.
***Definition of a session***:
> A connection formed between client and server established after user entered their user id and password on the client PC connecting to the server.

Now that we know what a Session is,
***Definition of Session-Hijacking***:
> Process of taking over a legitimately established session by using (but not limited to) techniques like [[Cross Site Scripting (XSS) Attack\|Cross Site Scripting (XSS) Attack]] and [[CSRF Attack\|CSRF Attack]].

Session Hijacking was a big problem back in the day when no countermeasures were known.

### Root Causes
The Following reasons are the root cause why Session Hijacking Attacks are successful against the website/software/service to be secured:
- NO account lockout for invalid session IDs
- Insecure Handling of Session ID and Password (no hashing)
- Weak session ID generation algorithm
- Indefinite session expiration time (Sessions must expire after X amount of inactivity) i.e., [[Cyber Security Principles\|Principle of Adequate Protection]]
- Small session ID Length.

### Various Types
- ***Session Sniffing***: Attackers find session IDs by aiming their sniffing on specific target (s). 
- ***Predicting Session Tokens***: Making an educated guess by looking at the session tokens and trying to crack a pattern (if any).
- ***Man-in-the-middle Session Hijack***: Attacker intercepts a session directly. 
- ***Man-in-the-browser Session Hijack***: Attacker uses browser scripts or mallicious extensions among other known attacks like [[Cross Site Scripting (XSS) Attack\|Cross Site Scripting (XSS) Attack]].

### Network Layer Session Hijacking
While other types seen in [[Session Hijacking#Various Types\|#Various Types]] were Session Hijacking attacks based in the [[Application Layer\|Application Layer]], it is important to note that Session Hijacking can also be [[Network Layer\|Network Layer]]-based where the objective is to hinder the functionalities at Network Layer and [[Transport Layer\|Transport Layer]].

There are a lot of types of Network Layer Session Hijacking.
1. ***TCP/IP Session Hijack***: Predicting the TCP/IP sequence numbers.
2. ***RST Hijacking***: Sending RST signal to the server with victims spoofed IP address and predicted packet sequence number.
3. ***UDP Hijacking***: The objective is to fool the target to mistake the attackerâ€™s machine as the server. Attacker will send faster response than the server to make the target believe attacker is the server.

### Countermeasures
- Use Network Monitoring services like an [[Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IDPS)\|IDPS]] & monitor ARP Broadcast Traffic Anomalies.
- Disable auto-running of scripts in the browser.
- Always check permissions needed by the extension before using.
- Use stronger [[Authentication\|Authentication]] mechanisms such as [[Kerberos\|Kerberos]].
- Use technologies such as [[IPSec (IP Security)\|IPSec (IP Security)]] and [[Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)\|SSL]] in applications and websites.
	- IPSec basically is used to establish a [[Virtual Private Network (VPN)\|VPN]] to secure the [[Objectives of Cyber Security\|Objectives of Cyber Security]] for IP Traffic.
	- IPSec is comprsed of a minimum of three algorithms 
		- A [[Symmetric Key Encryption\|Symmetric Key Encryption]] Algorithm for [[Confidentiality\|Confidentiality]]
		- A [[Hashing\|Hashing]] Algorithm for [[Integrity\|Integrity]]
		- Some form of [[Authentication\|Authentication]], generally via [[Digital Signatures\|Digital Signatures]].
