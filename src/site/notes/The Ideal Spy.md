# The Ideal Spy - what they look like
A lot of people may think of James Bond when imagining the Perfect or the Ideal Spy.


>"In contrast to James Bond, MI6 officers are not for taking moral shortcuts. In fact, a strong ethical core is one of the first qualities we look for in our staff. It is safe to say that James Bond wouldn't get through our recruitment process..."
> ~ Alex Younger, Head of the [[MI6\|MI6]] as quoted in *'The Unending Game'* page 10.

He is more similar to George Smiley from [[Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy\|Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy]] than James Bond.

The Ideal Spy works with the techology - working and finding online news, connnecting the dots, processing the informationa and sending it to his consumers (superiors who will further connect it and present it). At the same time. The Ideal Spy must not forget [[HUMINT\|HUMINT]]

The Ideal Spy never forgets about dual-use technology. Such as [[Uranium\|Uranium]] (which could be used for both [[Nuclear Fission Reactors\|Nuclear Fission Reactors]] and [[Nuclear Bombs\|Nuclear Bombs]])

The Ideal Spy learns & applies [[The Art of Intelligence Collection\|The Art of Intelligence Collection]] absolutely perfectly.

Other important skills to become The Ideal Spy for the Intelligence Bureau:
- ***Mastery over oneself & control over emotions*** - analyse everything and be alert all the time to find maneuvers being done against you.
- Mastery in dealing with [[Types of HUMINT sources\|Types of HUMINT sources]].
- ***Develop Patience*** - impatience makes you look weak.
- ***Never let anything surprise you*** - always be alert - work on all various possiblities - how things could go wrong - the dangers that lay ahead & how to avoid, prevent & prempt them.
- ***Keep your mouth shut*** and ***develop the skill*** to ***memorise a face or a document*** as much as you can ***in one glance***.
- ***Develop Listening Ability*** - being a good listener helps understanding and breaking down what the other person says.
