# Indian Diaspora
> A [[Diaspora\|Diaspora]] of Indians living abroad across the world as [[Non-Residential Indians (NRIs)\|Non-Residential Indians (NRIs)]], [[Overseas Citizens of India (OCIs)\|Overseas Citizens of India (OCIs)]] and [[People of Indian Origin (PIOs)\|People of Indian Origin (PIOs)]]. Often the people who are [[Stateless Person of Indian Origin (SPIO)\|Stateless Person of Indian Origin (SPIO)]] with no documents to prove Indian Origin also are included.

Recently, all people with PIO and OCI cards were merged into a singular [[Overseas Citizens of India (OCIs)\|OCI]] Category.
For the Indian Government, "Indian Diaspora" contains every living or dead human who can trace their roots to India or who are Indian Citizens living abroad, temporarily or permanently.

### History
Indians have been migrating since history, sometimes for a thrill of adventure while othertimes it may be trade or wars. {see: [[Indian Diaspora#^1\|1]], [[Indian Diaspora#^2\|2]]}
The Indian Culture and Civilisation has left its imprint on South East Asia and Central Asia.

But the large scale migrations happened firstly during the Era of Colonisation where people who were non-white by skin colour were sold in markets as labourers or sold as Indentured Labourers after the abolition of slavery in British, French and Dutch Colonies in 1834, 1846 and 1873 respectively. Large amounts of Indians were recruited as indentured labourers to be transported to different parts of the Empire. {see: [[Indian Diaspora#^3\|3]]}

Indentured Labour was a Euphemism for slavery without directly calling it such, contracts that seemed Lucrative on paper where the name of the location they were being taken to was also often wrong. Indentured Labour was also used with African People to make slavery not seem like slavery.

1946 Act of the US Congress made even a small number of Indians get Citizenship since they came as Indentured Labourers and stayed the same for generations. Smaller ghettos of Indentured Labourers (including Indians) started forming in the UK, USA and Australia. Indentured Indians protested for Indian Independence in California, Canada etc. {see: [[Indian Diaspora#^4\|4]], [[Indian Diaspora#^5\|5]]} 

Indian Communities lead the Independence movment for Fiji & many Caribbean Islands.

The Second Wave of Indian Migration came during the World Wars where many Indians who could afford to stay in Europe or other countries stayed back there either since they wanted a better or they had no way to make it back anymore (discharged from service due to injuries or disabilities, sometimes loss of hearing due to bombings)

### Size & Spread
Indian Diaspora is found on pretty much every continent of the planet except Antarctica (unless you include the Antartic Research Centre of India).

As of December 2016, there are 31 Million People that identify by the definition of Indian Diaspora given at the start of this note. Out of this 31 Million, 17 Million were PIOs and about 13 Million were NRIs. As of 2025, there are 44 Million people of Indian Diaspora in the USA alone. 

The Indian Diaspora is spread in Saudi Arabia, the USA, the UAE, Malaysia, Myanmar, the UK, Sri Lanka, Australia and South Africa in the heaviest numbers. The Diaspora is growing in regions of Europe New Zealand, Africa, Japan, South Korea among other [[State (United Nations)\|States]] around the world.

### Global Image
Indian Diaspora is looked at as a "model minority" which is comprised of many high achievers and accomplished individuals - especially in the [[Anglosphere\|Anglosphere]] - USA, Canada, UK and Australia.
Recently there are increased cases of [[Racism Against Indians\|Racism Against Indians]] not only over the Internet but also in real life.

### Advantages
Firstly, the large amount of Indians in other countries can affect their policies with the power to vote if the host [[State (United Nations)\|state]] is a democracy.

Secondly, China's economic growth story was mainly comprised of [[Ethnicity\|ethnically]] Chinese overseas citizens investing hevaily in China during the 1970s and 1980s. Indian Government hopes to recreate that with the Indian Diaspora.

Thirdly, India is a big market due to the massive population. Consumerism can be easily promoted as India is beginning to grow into a sizable middle class where people are getting more & more open to exploring products & many are ready to take loans for premium products that may be seen as a Premium Product like Louis Vuitton Bags and iPhones.

### Challenges
Sometimes, the diaspora's demands may not be Indian Government's priority & other times the Indian Government's stand may not be the diaspora's priority.
