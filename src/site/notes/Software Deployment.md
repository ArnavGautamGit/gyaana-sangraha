# Software Deployment
> The last step in the process of [[Project Scheduling\|Project Scheduling]] which requires the finished [[Software Development Project\|Project]] to be deployed and then maintained (if the need exists for a live-service software)

There are different locations of deployement depending upon the software, if it is web-base we may try render with uptime robot for maintainance. If it is a app then put it up on an app store and no need for maintainance.
