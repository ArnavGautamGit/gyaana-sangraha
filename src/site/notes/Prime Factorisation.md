# Prime Factorisation
> The process of finding [[Prime Factors\|Prime Factors]] of a given number or representing the given number as a product of its Prime Factors is called [[Prime Factorisation\|Prime Factorisation]].

Prime Factorisation of a large number represented as:
$$\Large 10 = 2 \times 5$$
here we see that 10 is factored as being a product of 2 and 5 which are both [[Prime Factors\|Prime Factors]].
