# Welcome to ज्ञानसंग्रह !!

ज्ञानसंग्रह is a Sanskrit name formed by the concatenation of two Sanskrit Words: 
1. ज्ञान (Knowledge or Wisdom) 
2. संग्रह (Repository)

Putting them together you can easily understand that this is a Knowledge Repository which I use for learning in public and simultaneously backing up my notes via GitHub.

You are free to press Ctrl+K (or Cmd+K for Mac Users) to open the Search bar & search for a specific item or note if you want to look for something specific or click on the Hamburger/Menu icon on the top left to open the list of notes to check them out! 

Please ignore the chaos in the menu/sidebar since organising this now will require me to manually move 1000+ notes into respective folders, not to mention first creating and sorting said folders.

The chaos in the menu/hamburger icon has now begun to help me since no one that truly has a life or a job will be free enough to try and look through the entire collection of notes unless their job involves attacking, troubling, defaming or at the very least spying on me and my thought-process. 

If you are here to hire me? Please look at [[My CompSci Résumé\|My CompSci Résumé]].
Else, please keep reading.

The First few thing you should know about me are the following:
- I am ready to offend people in my quest of the truth because I believe that one often needs to ask uncomfortable & offensive questions in order to get the answers. 
	- Which is precisely why I have zero qualms in passing harsh criticism to some of the very popular books marketed by YouTubers. I have heavily critiqued books like [[Books Library/Ikigai - The Japanese Secret to a Long and Happy Life\|Ikigai]] and [[Books Library/The Art of Thinking Clearly\|The Art of Thinking Clearly]].
- I usually do not write much in Politics, so there are no problems there. Even when I do, I will never put them out in public unless they are so heavily researched that I can survive a lawsuit.

# Intro to the संग्रह (Repository)
I am a proud Indian who believes that Sanskrit is the way of reviving the unity of my country which lays fractured in the wake of Internet Echo Chambers.
As a proud Sanskrit-learner I have divided the entire Repository into a Sanskrit Theme. At the same time, if you want to explore more, you can check the [[Learning Sanskrit\|Learning Sanskrit]] note.

The primary language of the Repository is English for the reason that English is the language of the Internet and insures maximum penetration in the same. 
I would have loved to make notes in Sanskrit but only 73,000 or so people would understand it. (As of the 2011 Census of India,the number of Sanskrit speakers in India are around 73,000)

Apart from this I talk of many Computer Science & Cyber Security Topics:
[[Cryptography & its Applications\|Cryptography & its Applications]]
[[Ethical Hacking & Prevention\|Ethical Hacking & Prevention]]

I talk of many Social Science subjects:
[[International Studies\|International Studies]]
[[Critical Theories of Literature\|Critical Theories of Literature]]
[[Psycho-Analysis in Literature\|Psycho-Analysis in Literature]]

Apart from things I learnt in Academics, I also talk of many [[Books Library/Books\|Books]] I have read & reviewed here among many other notes in the Vault that you are free to see, you will also spot in-depth notes on [[Sukhoi SU-57 Felon\|Sukhoi SU-57 Felon]] and other [[Fifth-Generation Fighter Aircrafts\|Fifth-Generation Fighter Aircrafts]].

I would not call myself a polymath, but I will say that I am trying my best to become one.
