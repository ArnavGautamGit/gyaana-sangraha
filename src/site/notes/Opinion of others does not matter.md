# Opinion of others does not matter
> [!cite] Quote: *Meditations - Book 4 , Verse 20*
> "... Does the emerald lose its virtue if one praise it not? Can one by scanting praise depreciate gold, ivory or purple, a lyre or a dagger, a flower or a shrub?"
> 
> ~ Marcus Aurelius

Marcus argues that if one cannot depreciate the market value of gold or any other lesser valued material by insulting it then why should your value reduce in your own eyes since someone - no matter how close to you - said something about you?

Unless they are God, their opinion of you cannot change anything.
Unless they are God, their opinion is invaluable.
