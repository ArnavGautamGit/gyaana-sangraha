# Placebo Buttons
> Buttons which are placed only for the [[Placebo Effect\|Placebo Effect]] and are not connected to anything or any system. Pressing them or not has no effect on the system or environment.

In many offices and Hotels, Placebo Buttons are placed as dials to control the airflow from the AC vents - if they actually would work, it would cost them a lot of money (first to wire them right and then AC costs since some people would want it higher than others) so they placed these dials that are not connnected to anything - to give the illusion that they are doing something.

Even in buses ran by JIIT, there are many such cameras that look like they do something, but now everyone knows they do nothing.
