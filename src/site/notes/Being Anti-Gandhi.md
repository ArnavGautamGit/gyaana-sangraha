# Being Anti-Gandhi $\large\neq$ Condoning Godse 
Although I did not agree with Gandhi many times, but just as I mentioned in [[Being Anti-Ambedkar\|Being Anti-Ambedkar]] note, not liking Milk does not mean that I am Lactose Intolerant and not liking Gandhi does not mean I would wish death for him right after a prayer to God.

What Godse did was an Assasination (murder) and hence can never be justifiable since it is against the law in any civilised state. You don't have to be a snowflake to shoot somebody you don't agree with! You defeat them in a FAIR debate and claim victory -take away their followers, donations, voters LEGALLY not by taking the law in your own hands.
