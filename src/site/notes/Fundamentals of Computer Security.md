# Fundamentals of Computer Security
> Subject taught in 5th Semester of my B.Tech degree at Jaypee Institute of Information Technology (JIIT), Noida

Taught by Prof. Charu Gandhi who was the Head of Department at the time. She was and is an absolute Coconut who is hard on the outside but soft on the inside. Very protective like a foster mother but equally fierce if you knowingly make a mistake. Teaching Style is conversational and although does not follow the book exactly, it does not need to be. 

At the end of my 6th semester of college, she announced that she would be leaving the college. Her leaving JIIT was one of the signs that JIIT as a college is gonna go on a downward slope now. She kept the internal politics and power in check. She was kind of like Saddam Hussein (whose removal from power created the ISIS problem in Iraq & Syria).

Prof. Charu was easily the best CyberSec professor and one of the best in the CSE department (alongside Mukesh Saraswat sir).
