# Paleolithic Period
> Period of Human History which falls under [[Stone Age\|Stone Age]] where proto-humans began using stone tools to aid themselves in laying camps, hunting and collecting food.

This period was the longest period in Human history spanning from 500,000 BC to 10,000 BC subdivided into Lower, Middle and Upper Paleolithic phases choronologically.

Collectively during this period through all its phases:
Humans built prototyped, older stone versions of very blunt weapons such as hammers and as they learnt how to sharpen stone to a certain degree they were able to build rudimentary cleaver & chopper knives to chop soft muscle meat. These tools were discovered in excavations of historical camp locations. 

During this period, Humans also produced simple stick-figure paintings in caves around the world using blood for red colour, paste of leaves for green colour and blue from mixing water in the paste of mashed blueberries.

Humans understood tools, how to connect two objects with rope and figured out sharping stones. Eventually they were able to build complex stone tools such as spears, javelins, shields and even long needles. These are still rough tools and extremely prototypical weapons but they do exist.
