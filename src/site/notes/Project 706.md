# Project 706 - Pakistan's Nuclear Program of the 1970s
Project 706 is the codename of the nuclear program of Pakistan which was first started by then PM of The Islamic Republic of Pakistan, [[Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto\|Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto]] in the late 1960s when he used to be in power but it took up real pace when India conducted their nuclear tests in 1974 near Pokhran.

Although originally planned to use [[Plutonium\|Plutonium]] as the nuclear bomb, somewhere between 1975 and 1978, the plan shifted to [[Uranium\|Uranium]]-based [[Nuclear Bombs\|Nuclear Bombs]] a long time ago. The funding was arranged from the Saudi Monarchy, Libya and other Islamic Countries by playing the Islamic Card of the muslim brotherhood by crying the crocodile tears of "Who will support the Islamic country of Pakistan if not for the Islamic country of \<insert name\>" 

Infact, if the book by then R&AW Secretary, Vikram Sood - [[Books Library/The Unending Game\|The Unending Game]] is to be blindly trusted, it should be noted that the shift from Plutonium-based Nukes to Uranium-based Nukes was done in 1975 and Pakistan was in the market for Gas Centrifuges & a plant for the same in 1976 & was in a hurry.

Abdul Qadeer Khan stole the uranium enrichment technology for centrifuges from the Netherlands. Some German companies provided vacuum pumps & gas purification equipment. A.Q Khan was no spy, just the right man at the right place, at the right time. These German Companies signed contracts with Arshad Amjad and Arbid Private Limited to build 3 plants that would allow Pakistan to freeely manufacture & purify Uranium-Hexafluoride which is imperitive for enrichment of U-238 (Uranium with 238 nucleoids) to U-235 (Uranium with 235 nucleoids). The three plants were sent to Pakistan on three Hercules C-130 Transport Aircrafts.

the details of what happened in the 1970s from the Pakistani side were mainly disclosed by Steve Weissman and Herbert Krosney, authors of *"The Islamic Bomb"*. the gentleman wrote about three Pakistanis approaching the swiss firm *Vakuum Apparat Technik* to buy highly specialised valves for a centrifuge enrichment plant. They knew the restrictions & the loopholes in the said restrictions imposed by The London Club (informal name of [[Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG)\|Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG)]] since the group first met in London, 1975). They knew centrifuges were restricted but not the valves for them.

The Pakistanis operated in Britain via various shell companies run by Abdus Salam (not the Nobel Prize winner, it was someone else with the same name) the biggest ones being S.R. International (originally "Salam Radio") and Weargate. 30 Inverters were received via Weargate from Ernest Piffl of Team Industries. The Birtish underestimated the Pakistanis thinking that the Pakis are not going to know what to do with these equipments even if they got them. They got the wakeup call when calls for modifications and enhancements were made. 

Even after all this and through Agha Hasan Abedi's private bank which collected funds to fund shady stuff including the Pakistani Nuclear Program, by 1978, Pakistan was only able to successfully enrich a very small amount of Uranium and that too was not weapons-grade. i.e., not ready for missiles. That would mean more money. Also in 1978, One of [[Morarji Desai's Blunders\|Morarji Desai's Blunders]] caused them (the Pakistanis) to realise that R&AW had infiltrated them and it was the huntdown of all the R&AW's "moles" and only after which their project could move ahead.

Thankfully for them by 1979, the Soviet-Afghan War was in full swing - which meant Pakistan would get money flowing from Uncle Sam (USA) which the Pakistanis would secretly used to fund their nuclear weapons program. 

A.Q Khan was going to be sidelined before the tests in May 1998 in Chagai yet named the "Father of the Pakistani Nuclear Program" although we know it was [[Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto\|Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto]] instead. Khan even tried whitewashing Musharraf and was allowed to "disappear" honourably in February 2004 with the title of "National Asset". Evidence had mounted steadily by 2003 & the [[International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)\|International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)]] knew but could not implicate Pak for they were still needed for USA to fight the Al-Qaeda. 
Not to mention Abdul Qadeer Khan had helped North Korea and Libya to build Nuclear Bombs in the 1990s.
