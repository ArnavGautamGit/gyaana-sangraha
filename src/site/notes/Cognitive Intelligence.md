# Cognitive Intelligence
> Often confused with the [[Intelligence Quotient (IQ)\|Intelligence Quotient (IQ)]], it is a objective rigourous measurement of intellectual ability. It doefines whether a person is capable of [[Critical Thinking\|Critical Thinking]] and Problem Solving among other activities & also measures their proficiency in them.

To keep it separate from the note about Espionage, I have named it slightly differently, although, Cognitive Intelligence is preferred and almost non-negotiable in the world of [[Intelligence (Espionage)\|Intelligence (Espionage)]] unless one is in a desk job. I guess they aren't so unrelated as we think since an intelligent (smart) person is needed to for intelligence analysis.

Cognitive Intelligence is broadly classified into two parts in Modern Scientific Literature - it can either be Fluid or Crystallised.

### Fluid Intelligence
The part of a person's Intelligence which is the ability to learn, grasp concepts, process information and solve problems. This peaks early in adulthood and then starts declining over the years.

### Crystalline Intelligence
The part of a person's Intelligence that is based on knowledge gained and retained over time. It also peaks in the early adulthood but stays roughly more or less quite stable.
