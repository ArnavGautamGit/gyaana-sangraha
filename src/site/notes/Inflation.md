# Inflation
> A phenomenon where the prices of Goods and Services increase exponentially year-on-year. It is also said what Compounding creates, Inflation eats. 

Inflation is considered better than deflation for any economy - since it shows that the public's demand for goods is increasing.

Once upon a time being a crorepati was rare, now it is getting a lot less rare.
