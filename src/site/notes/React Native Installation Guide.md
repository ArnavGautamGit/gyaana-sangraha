# React Native Installation Guide
> The Installation guide as expected from developers in big tech companies. It was originally covered in [[React Native Mastery (Course)\|React Native Mastery (Course)]].

React Native Installation requires us to install a few things:
1. React Native CLI (for me, OS is Linux)
2. Android Studio
	1. Particularly the Adroid SDK Platform Tools
3. [[Java\|Java]] (from openjdk) on your OS.

Hitesh has made another video on [[Java Installation Guide\|Java Installation Guide]].
HItesh says that Android Studio is the easiest way to get [[Android Debug Bridge (ADB)\|Android Debug Bridge (ADB)]] without missing files. In his experience it is better than getting ADB separately.
