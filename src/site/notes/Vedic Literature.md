# Vedic Literature
> Literature written by the Vedic Indians during the [[Indian Vedic Period\|Indian Vedic Period]]. Some works were added in the [[Late Vedic Phase\|Late Vedic Phase]] too. Also called as "Shruti" since it was transmitted orally by listening to recitations.

Vedic Literature was comprised primarily of [[Veda\|Veda]] texts called Veda because they represented a collection of knowledge they had received from Brahma, Naarada and the compositions of various Rishis (male sages) and Rishikās (female sages).

Each [[Veda\|Veda]] had 4 parts. First was Samhita which meant "collection".
Each Samhita has a collection of Vedic Era hymns and mantras which refer to locations, sages and gods - often praised them too.

When the Brahmins went to the forests to reflect on such things, they started to realise some philosophy that is partly spiritual and partly material. These reflections were collected down into Aranyakas. Meanwhile other brahmins needed a ritualistic interpretation for daily rituals in the [[Yajna\|Yajna]], these were named as Brahmanas.

In the [[Late Vedic Phase\|Late Vedic Phase]], after the discovery of Iron at Atranjikhera, purely phillosophical interpretation of the Vedas in the form of 108 Upanishads - offering a purely spiritual way of life which resonated with the Vedic people.
