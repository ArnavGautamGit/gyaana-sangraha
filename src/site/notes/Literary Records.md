# Literary Records
> A type of evidence of [[History\|History]] where the contemporary people have left notes about their time and how things are like in these parts of land.

Things like Autobiographies & Biographies of important and powerful people down to random sketched notes of a shepherd or peasant - all count in it. The former counts a bit more than the latter but no type of literary evidence is ignored.

Although I am not a famous person, I am not a rich person and I do not know if I am an interesting person & how interesting my life is may be subjective but I hope one day this vault or any piece of it could act as a Literary Record of the Human Civilisation of our time.

The biggest example of Literary Records is the example of [[Vedic Literature\|Vedic Literature]] which gae us all the information we need for [[Indian Vedic Period\|Indian Vedic Period]].
