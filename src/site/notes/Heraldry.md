# Heraldry
> Study of [[Heraldic Achievement\|Heraldic Achievements]] and [[Coat of Arms\|Coat of Arms]] of various surrounding lands and those that exist in lands of their own. The Study is now limited to Europe - where these Achievements were first seen.

Heralds were originally like [[Diplomacy\|diplomats]], envoys or messengers who world meet other kings and lords. To better survey and understand who they were dealing with, they began learning the meanings and depictions of their [[Heraldic Achievement\|Heraldic Achievements]] until it eventually became their job as Heralds reached expertise.

### Varying Traditions
Regardless of its origins, Heraldry was first practiced in Europe in the 12th century. It gained popularity in the 13th and 14th century. It came with its own laws as seen in [[Laws of Heraldry\|Laws of Heraldry]]. Even in Europe, the Laws have inconcistencies and some diversity depending upon the location since Heraldic Traditions saw changes as the practice moved from location to location. For Example: the [[English Heraldic Traditions\|English Heraldic Traditions]] completely differ from the [[French Heraldic Traditions\|French]] or [[Portuguese Heraldic Traditions\|Portuguese]] Traditions although certain core rules are the same.

### Heraldry in India
The practice of Heraldry in India has been inspired by many European Empires (French, British and Portuguese) who colonised parts of India during 18th to 20th Century since it helped the Europeans keep track of various kingdoms, they also brought their own customs. Many Laws were common and a wide majority of kingdoms in India followed either the [[English Heraldic Traditions\|English]] or the [[French Heraldic Traditions\|French Heraldic Traditions]].

### Registering Private Coat of Arms
Most countries that have an monarchical system of government (i.e., are run by monarchs) have a heraldic institution or college of arms which will register said arms for civic and monarchic bodies given that they have a culture of heraldry.

If the country is a republic or said monarchy has no culture of heraldry, there is no guarantee of a coat of arms registration college/institution being present (most republics do not have them), in that case, one can go to the [Heraldry of the World (HOTW)](https://www.heraldry-wiki.com/wiki/Heraldry_of_the_world) to register their arms with them. Note that this is an informal registration, there are other ways which include mailing a sealed envelope of your heraldic design to yourself - effectively timestamping the creation of the achievement.

Even my [[Personal Coat of Arms\|Personal Coat of Arms]] are registered on HOTW.
One has to send an email in prescribed format at: hotwregister@gmail.com
To check the format, visit the [HOTW's Arms Regisration Website](https://www.heraldry-wiki.com/wiki/How_to_submit_a_registration)

> [!important] IMPORTANT: Format of Registration
> It is stated at HOTW that if the format of registration is not respected, your registration will be rejected automatically.
