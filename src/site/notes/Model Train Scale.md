# Model Train Scale
> A (almost) standardised set of ratio of [[Model Trains\|Model Trains]] size to IRL Train size. The only few popular scales that seem to not be standardised worldwide but have different definitions in different countries (sometimes) seem to be the N-scale. 

As said in the main [[Model Trains\|Model Trains]] note,

Just like IRL Trains, these trains can also have [[Standard Gauge\|Standard Gauge]], [[Narrow Gauge\|Narrow Gauge]] and [[Broad Gauge\|Broad Gauge]] in the sense that an S-scale train can run on Standard Gauge of S-gauge while some models may be made to run on narrower HO-gauge or on broader O-gauge tracks if they are Narrow or Broad Gauge variants respectively.

It is also to be noted that the common place for this happening seems to be the O-scale since other scales are so spaced out with no OO-scale or confusion like that. 

Talking about OO-scale and other such exotic scales that have not reached wide popularity in the market to be commercially viable, we won't talk out them in this note but may make separate notes for them.

### The G-scale
The "G" in stands for "Garden" and it is most-often considered an outdoor scale, standing at 1:25 of an IRL train, this is not far behind although one may need a massive space to make them work. It is the biggest widely-available scale in Model Trains. The "Background Scenery" is basically your house in which the Train is run.

Tend to be more expesnive than indoor counterparts and less standardised in size with Narrow Gauge variants of G-scale (ranging from 1:24 to 1:29 in size and there is a "F-scale" variant of 1:20.4 in size). Not recommended if you don't know what you are doing or have someone around you who does.

Generally seen as an outlet of those people who love gardening and model railroading at the same time & aim to decorate their gardens with sizable trains.

### The O-scale
The "O" in "O-scale" stands for "Outdoor" and it is also another outdoor based scale which is downsized to 1:48 from the 1:25 G-scale because some people may have smaller gardens or may have tracks that partially go outside the house and partially stay inside. Similar to G-scale, your house and the room in which the train is run inside is the background scene. However it is important to say that just because you run O-scale or G-scale trains, it does not automatically disallow you from having scenery in the background - but that would be expensive.

With that said, O-scale is more of a collector's scale where the trains are made for dun, to look big and fun to look at for kids. O-scale has the O-N30 like options of having Narrow Gauge O-scale running on HO tracks while also having the regular O-scale tracks.

### The S-scale
An old scale of Model Trains nestled between O and HO scales which used to be very popular and famous once upon a time but became a bit of a niche later. There is a chance of resurgence but people only go for this if they have very old [[Rolling Stock\|Rolling Stock]] from an era where S-scale used to be popular enough. It is 1:64 scale of a IRL train.

### The HO-scale
The "HO" is (I assume) suppose to be "Half-O" since these are only marginally bigger than the exact half of an O-scale train in all three dimensions. It is 1:87 of an IRL train which makes it good for tracks which have massive dedicated space inside (an entire spare room or part of your basement).

It is by-far the most common and easily available train size due to it being the largest size that can fully work indoors while also being the only track where the detailing and background scenery becomes a thing - people decorate the backgrounds of their trains a lot - it is a lot easier as well.

It is called as the OO Scale sized at 1:76 in the UK whereas the "HO" is more of a US-based scale.
HO and OO scales are the smallest scales where you will get a Steam [[Locomotive\|Locomotive]] which is accurately modelled to the T with water vapour-based steam and perfect sound - both of which starts to muddle as we go smaller in size.

### The N-scale
The scale that has started rivalling the popularity of the HO-scale due to the details being present while being small enough to fit a scene in a small flat/apartment. The trains are just as detailed but roughly half-the-size of the HO-scale. In the USA, N-scale is defined to be 1:160 while in the UK, it bigger at 1:148 of an IRL train.

[[Kato Precision Engineering\|Kato Precision Engineering]] is a brand that fully support the N-scale partially also due to the scale being perfect for Japanese and Asian Houses which are much smaller on average than European or American housing.

It is generally noted that N-scale is preferred by people who do not have much interest in any Steam [[Locomotive\|Locomotive]] (due to quality steam models having the train releasing steam/water vapour which is too hard to engineer on any scale smaller than HO without making pieces unaffordable). Only a few exceptions such as BigBoy models as shown in Steve's Video {source: [[Model Train Scale#^2\|#^2]]}

N-scale is also preferred by those on the Internet who like to run really long trains without many switching operations (i.e., preferred for running Mainline Trains).

Background scenery gets expansive and beautifully detailed on scales at or under N-scale.

### The Z-scale
Now we enter the territory of low-availability. Details on the trains are lost here as the size reaches the Z-scale's 1:220 of an IRL train - making a single Z-scale [[Locomotive\|Locomotive]] be the length of your finger assuming you are an average human (3 inches or 9 centimetres long to be exact). A train of 5 cars (including the Locomotive)

The good thing is that the scenery really dominates here - if you want to recreate - say the entirety or some part of Delhi Metro in an empty bedroom, Z-scale is your friend.

If you are getting old, or expect to grow old with your set - switching operations are nearly impossible without help at this scale.

### The T-scale
This is the area of selected availability - only a select few pieces are made for T-scale.
NO company is crazy enough to exclusively manufacture T-scale. The details and some measurements for the wheel-to-coach ratio may be altered to even keep the train on-track at those levels and stuff may get expensive. Switching or re-railing the train is impossible without the included re-railer or other similar tools. It is extremely miniscule at 1:450 of a IRL train i.e., very close to 4 centimtres in length (approx. 1.75-2 inches).
