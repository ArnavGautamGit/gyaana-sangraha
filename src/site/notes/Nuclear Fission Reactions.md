# Nuclear Fission Reactions
Nuclear Fission Reactions are detailed theoretical study and derived chemical reactions which map a particular input of [[Fissile Material\|Fissile Material]] and Free Neutrons and the output energy and byproducts.

Before we move onto actual reactions, format of a reaction is givn below:
 $\Large ^{X}_{Y}\text{A}$

here, A is the [[Fissile Material\|Fissile Material]], X is the [[Mass Number\|Mass Number]] whereas Y is the [[Atomic Number\|Atomic Number]]
