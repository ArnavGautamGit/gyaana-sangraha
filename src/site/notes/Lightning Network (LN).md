# Lightning Network (LN)
> Alternative chain or "side-highway" to the original, main [[Blockchain\|Blockchain]] where popular Cryptocurrencis like [[Bitcoin (BTC)\|Bitcoin (BTC)]] are hosted.

I know LN primarily from [[NOSTR\|NOSTR]].
Lightning Network was made because the original blockchain had pricing on transaction fees set according to the then predicted value of popular [[Cryptocurrency\|Cryptocurrencies]] which got blown out of the park by the time 2019 rolled around.

Lightning Network works as an alternate chain with low transaction fees and higher speed (as claimed by the name and by [[NOSTR\|NOSTR]]).
