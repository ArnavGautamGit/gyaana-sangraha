# Parliamentary Motions
> Motions are a method of introducing the topic of discussion to the House. It can be understood as a way of introducing problems to the House & inviting discussion on the same.

If a motion is raised by an MP who does not hold a position in the [[Cabinet of Ministers\|Cabinet of Ministers]], it is called a private motion. If raised by a Minister, then such a motion is called a Public Motion.

Once a motion has been raised, it is voted upon by the House to decide whether atleast the majority of the House wishes to discuss the motion and its subject. If 50% of more of the house votes in favour of the motion to be discussed, it is accepted.

Once the Speaker/Chairman (Presiding Officer of the House) decides that they have heard enough discussion & a solution is reached (regardless of if it includes the introduction of a new [[Parliamentary Bills\|Parliamentary Bill]]) then the solution is voted upon to see if at least 50% of the members of the house agree on the solution. This solution is known as a [[Parliamentary Resolutions\|Resolution]].
