# Subpeona Requests
> Official Government Request made in court for the social media platform or any other private company to reveal all of the exact computer data in their possession about an individual or set of individuals whose data is requested by the Subpeona.

Two important things to note is that a blanket Subpeona Request encompassing all users or all citizens cannot be made in most countries either by law or due tothe government getting bad press. Secondly, for a subpeona request, the government or any of its agencies filing the Subpeona Request has to provide the userID the targeted company uses to index its users. It could be employee IDs, phone numbers, names etc.

In the context of [[Personal Online Privacy\|Personal Privacy]]
One must always be mindful that the bigger the company the more data they have to reveal about you when under a Subpeona Request. It is always important to keep your data separate over many different services so that one place does NOT have enough data to target you personally in case the data gets leaked in data breaches.
