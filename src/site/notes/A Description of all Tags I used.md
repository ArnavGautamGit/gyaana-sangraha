# List of Tags along with what they mean

If you are seeing this on ज्ञानसंग्रह, most likely you will never see these tags anyway. So don't bother.

- `#CompSci` - attached to all notes which I made during or using the information/knowledge gained through my Bachelors of Computer Science that I did at JIIT. It will soon be replaced by `#Academics`.
- `#CompNet` - All notes that discuss Computer Networks
- `#CyberSec` - All notes that discuss Cyber Security
- `#coding` - Contains notes about Coding Languages, Technologies in Computer Science that I learnt OUTSIDE of my formal degrees. The notes are expansive and long in case of coding languages so that I have everything in one place.
- `#Physics` - All notes that discuss Physics.
- `#idea` - All notes that deal Business and Reasech ideas.
- `#Mathematics` - All notes that discuss Mathematics.
- `#Literature` - All notes that reveal my understanding of Theories of Literature that I studied throughout life. Some part of it, I did study at my Computer Science Bachelor's but I am not sure if I want to club it with that.

- `#Espionage` - A tag that deals solely and solely in learning the art of Espionage & collecting news and case-studies of Espionage in my preparation of my dream job - joining the Intelligence Bureau.
- `#Fitness` - tags that map my fitness knowledge and journey. A big chunk of fitness notes were taken offline (on physical notepads and pocket diaries)
- `#Football` - My Sports Notes, which are mainly surrounded around Cricket, Football and Olympic Shooting - but I barely get time to write them down.
- `#GATE` - Notes based on my preparation of the GATE exam where I study my CompSci subjects once again to go for a masters in my field, if I ever so wish.
