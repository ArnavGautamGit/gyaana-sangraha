# Maps, Range & Movement
Although Visual Aids are not required to play, Maps are often appreciated in the play since players are able to avoid utter chaos.

### Movement & Combat Range
Ranges in game for spells, movement and everything else are not hardcoded but abstract. They use a arbitrary range. For more realism, the ranges could be reduced but for more fantastical combat and movement, the ranges could be increased.

A good compromise between fantasy and realism for the ranges are given below:
1. Melee - Touching Range to upto 5 feet (Touching or one square)
2. Very Close - upto 10 feet
3. Close - upto 30 feet
4. Far - upto 100 feet
5. Very Far - upto 300 feet
6. Out of Range - Anything beyond 300 feet or off the map

For the people that would like this in metres, 3.3 Feet is 1 metre but the official rulebook only mentions it in feet (since Daggerheart is made in 'MURICA).

### Movement Rules
If you have already made an attack role, you can move to any loaction that is in close range from your current position in the same turn. This location must be somewhere your character could plausibly and easily reach within the narrative. If you want to move somewhere beyond your Close range but within Far or Very Far range, or if you want to reach an area that’s not easily accessible (such as one that requires climbing, swimming, or jumping), use the following rules.

If you’re not already making an action roll, or if you want to move farther than your Close range, you’ll need to succeed on an Agility Roll to safely reposition yourself. The GM sets this Difficulty depending on the situation. On a failure, you might only be able to move some of that distance, the adversaries might act before you can make it, or a hazard might prevent you from moving at all.

When an adversary is in the spotlight and makes a move such as attacking a target or picking a lock, the GM can move them within their Close range as part of their action. For example, the adversary can pick a lock to open a door and then move within their Close range toward a PC inside the room beyond. If the GM wants to move the adversary somewhere beyond their Close range but within their Far or Very Far range, this uses their entire action, but the adversary doesn’t have to succeed on an Agility Roll like a PC would.

### Cover & Line of Sight
Taking Cover behind a small barricade of fallen tree makes it harder for adversaries to target you. Attacks against you are made with disadvantage while you are behind cover. If the cover is big enough (for example: a wall) then attacks against you generally cannot be made.

AOE Damage and Explosions hit you regardless of being in cover or not as long as it is behind your cover (for example: an explosion still cannot affect you unless the explosion is on the same side of the wall as you).

### Area of Effect (AOE) Damage
To affect a group of targets, those targets must be clumped together in an area within Very Close range of a point you choose. You can always ask the GM if adversaries would be considered a group before you make a move. Regardless of the number of targets, you only make one attack roll and compare its result to the Difficulty of each eligible target to determine which creatures you succeed against. When your attack deals damage to more than one target, roll damage once and apply the total to each target the attack succeeded against.
