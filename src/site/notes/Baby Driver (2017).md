# Baby Driver (2017)

![Baby Driver.png](/img/user/Vaulted%20Images/Baby%20Driver.png)
A young boy named "Baby" gets unwillingly sucked in a criminal gang at a very young age as their getaway driver. Everything changes when he meets Deborah in the diner where his mom once worked at & a guy named "Bats" joins the criminal gang...

### Honest Spoiler-Free Review
It is a particularly amazing movie like many others directed by [[Edgar Wright\|Edgar Wright]] with the first one I watched being [[Scott Pilgrim vs the World (2010)\|Scott Pilgrim vs the World (2010)]]. 

It is a happy coincidence that the word "[[Blu-Ray Discs\|Blu-Ray Disc]]" & the title "Baby Driver" both have the same initals of "BD" & this is also the first movie i bought on disc! Although there have been scandals regarding Kevin Spacey & Ansel Elgort neither I knew about them before getting the disc nor have they been proved in court as of January 2026 so I do not think my purchase or appreciation of this film is wrong in any ethical way.

The movie is a phenomenal ride into the life of a getaway driver looking to leave the life of crime with the movie doing a great job in getting [[American Sign Language (ASL)\|American Sign Language (ASL)]] correct. The main protagonist named "Baby" faces chronic ringing in his ears & tries to drown it out with music which falls perfectly with the story as he prefers to listen to specific songs that are apt to the situation while conversely he likes to sync his activities to the beats & lyrics of the music he is listening to.

The themes ongoing around the movie are symbolism based on colours, song lyrics along with the evolution of Baby's morality as the movie goes on. It exceptionally uses music as a way to aid into colours changing as Baby being lost in his own world acts as a good justification for Baby seeing the exact words from the lyrics taken from the song randomly on the street when fetching coffee (for example).
