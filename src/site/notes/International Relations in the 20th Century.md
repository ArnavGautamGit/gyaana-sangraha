# International Relations in the 20th Century
> A note which aims to discuss International Diplomatic and Cooperative Relations in the 20th Centruy, Build-up to [[The First World War (WW1)\|The First World War (WW1)]] and the formation of the old [[League of Nations\|League of Nations]], Causes of the [[The Second World War (WW2)\|The Second World War (WW2)]] and the formation of [[United Nations (U.N)\|United Nations (U.N)]] in the backdrop of many former European colonies gaining Independence.

Source for this note (unless given otherwise) are the powerpoint slides presented and provided in the [[International Studies\|International Studies]] Course.

### Era of Colonisation
It is estimated that almost 85% of the World Population was coloniesd by 15% of the colonisers who came mostly from either Europe with the sole coloniser outside Europe being Japan.

The Portuguese & the Spanish were the pioneers in contemporary Colonisation & began fighting amongst themselves for territory. Revolts in their already colonised territories meant they were having a hard time maintaining colonies. The Pope had to step in to avoid Protestant Christian States joining the race of Colonisation. 

Due to the [[Inter Caetera of Pope Alexander VI\|Inter Caetera of Pope Alexander VI]], the Portuguese were given the right to invade the Indian Subcontinent and the Eastern World while the Spanish were given the right to invade the Western World and build colonies in North & South America. Protestant Christian States (like the UK and France) did not really care and invaded everyone & ended up as the largest force of all the Colonisers.

The Indian Subcontinent was colonised by the British while some minor parts of the subcontinent was controlled by the French and the Portuguese. Indonesia & many other countries in South East Asia were colonised by the Dutch & later by the Japanese.

The Germans were late to the Colonisation Game in the 1890s after [[Kaiser Wilhelm II\|Kaiser Wilhelm II]] had taken charge in 1888. To put things in perspective, it had already been more than 30 years since the Indian Revolt for Independence of 1857.

It is important to refresh background notes such as [[European Method of Colonisation\|European Method of Colonisation]] along with [[European Destruction of the Native Americas\|European Destruction of the Native Americas]]. (website viewers see: [[International Relations in the 20th Century#^1\|1]])

### Politics & Ideologies
Whenever there will be people who try to leverage targic economic conditions to push themselves up the political ladder and claim they can fix anything and all the problems a state has - beware of those people since they are called [[Fascism\|Fascists]].

The Rise of [[Fascism\|Fascism]] and the majority world leaders being men & most of them moving towards proposing War as the only "solution" to all problems, it was interesting to note that the Women began voicing their opinions that the biggest sufferers of Wars are women who lose children, husbands, fathers etc. 

This thought started propogating that men are war-mongerers and the women & children have to stand up for themselves. [[Feminism\|Feminism]] saw a rising number of women supporting it Post-War and took great strides. The thought that women had to conform to societal norms, be effectively banished from working in certain jobs and still had no say in choosing their political leaders even in the "democratic" governments make them not much different than dictatorships for the women. The World Wars brought women in the industries where they talked to men who were yet to be drafted and saw it first hand how a woman's world and a man's world were so drastically different despite potentially coming from the same city or neighbourhood.

### Post-WW2 Structure of International Relations
After the end of the [[The Second World War (WW2)\|The Second World War (WW2)]], The Yalta Conference was held in 1945. The President of the United States of America (Theodore Roosevelt), The Prime Minister of the UK (Winston Churchill) and the Leader of the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR)\|Soviet Union]] (Joseph Stalin) met in the conference to decide the structure of the post-colonial world since most of the world was either an ally of the USA or an ally of USSR.

The remaining few were colonies of the the UK and other European powers who would soon gain independence but would be so poor (so sucked dry) that they couldn't do anything.

This situation was very similar to how peaceful negotiations in the [[Russia-Ukraine War\|Russia-Ukraine War]] are being done by The President of United States of America (Donald Trump), The Prime Minister of the UK (Keir Stamer) and The President of Russia (Vladimir Putin) where the last person in the list was the invader of Ukraine.

In the Formation of the [[United Nations (U.N)\|United Nations (U.N)]] after the War, the [[Allied Powers\|Allied Powers]] were made the members of a group called the [[United Nations Security Council (U.N.S.C)\|United Nations Security Council (U.N.S.C)]] where they had the power to Veto any resolution regardless of it passing the [[United Nations General Assembly (U.N.G.A)\|United Nations General Assembly (U.N.G.A)]] or not.

This formed a [[Unipolar World\|Unipolar World]] where all the power was concentrated with one state or one group of states.

Soon after the formation of the [[United Nations (U.N)\|U.N]], 
the 1950s marked the beginning of [[The U.S-Soviet Cold War\|The U.S-Soviet Cold War]] where both of the states followed different Political and Economic Ideologies which caused a [[Cold War\|Cold War]] between the two countries which got very close to becoming a [[Full-Scale War\|Full-Scale War]] but did not. Rather, the two states engaged via [[Proxy War\|Proxy Wars]].

Some Countries (India included) began the [[Non-Alligned Movement (NAM)\|Non-Alligned Movement (NAM)]] where they refused to align with either party but due to our neighbours (Pakistan) alligning with the USA, we were eventually forced to seek allignment with the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR)\|Soviet Union]]. I am sure other countries also had their reasons.
