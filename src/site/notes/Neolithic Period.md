# Neolithic Period
> Period of Human History in the Later part of [[Stone Age\|Stone Age]] where after the proto-humans navigate the landscape after Ice Age begins to end and humans slowly start evolving to [[Homo Sapiens\|Homo Sapiens]].

Neolithic Period is generally measured to be between 7000 BC to 4000 BC
This is the period where the proto-humans first began farming. In India, the first site where evidence of farming was found was Mehrgarh (which is in present-day Pakistan). Since humans started farming, speed of evolution had slowed down considerably. It is debatable whether it was due to diet change or lifestyle change.

Surplus food and grains needed to be stored for a rainy day and humans created pottery for the first time in human history. [[Pottery\|Pottery]] of this period was made of stone and humans moved towards a more sedentary lifestyle of sticking to the place they lived at and making permanent settlements. 

Since farming requires larger swathes of land and more number of people are required to make sure wild animals and pests do not eat the produce before it provides grain, tribes often have to come together as a larger tribe-group to collaborate together and share the produce. This is how villages began to pop up. Permanent settlements of 100 to 500 humans formed a typical village.
