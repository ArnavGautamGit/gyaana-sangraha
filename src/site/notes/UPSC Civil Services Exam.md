# UPSC Civil Services Exam
> An exam conducted by the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) to recommend to government to hire specific candidates over others based on whether they are a good fit for the position after passing the exam.

The Exam is conducted in 2 successive stages: Preliminary & Main. These stages are called "Prelims" and "Mains" respectively. The Exam is given by 14,00,000 students each year and then around 14,000 are selected for Mains - which is conducted in written and interview.

## Syllabus for Prelims
The Syllabus provided by the UPSC is very broad since naming specifics means being bound to them, Syllabus for Mains goes into multiple pages listing topics itself - not the case with Prelims.

The Prelims is divided into 2 papers: [[General Awareness\|General Studies]] and [[Civil Services Aptitude Test (CSAT)\|Civil Services Aptitude Test (CSAT)]]. Where the CSAT is qualifying in nature & the person only needs to score 33% (67 out of 200) on the test, the cutoff to filter the students & decide who will sit for the Mains exam is decided by the GS portion of the test.

The [[General Awareness\|General Studies]] paper is 2 hours long and has the following syllabus: 
- [[Indian History\|Indian History]] and [[Indian National Movement\|Indian National Movement]] (except Post-Independence one)
- [[Indian Geography\|Indian Geography]] and [[World Geography\|World Geography]] including the physical, social and economic geography.
- [[Indian Polity & Governance\|Indian Polity & Governance]] 
	- [[Constitution of India\|Constitution of India]]
	- [[Indian Political System\|Indian Political System]]
	- [[Panchayati Raj\|Panchayati Raj]]
	- Public Policies
- Economic & Social Development - Sustainable Development, Poverty, Inclusion, Demographics, Social Sector initiatives
- Environmental Ecology, [[Biodiversity\|Biodiversity]], [[Climate Change\|Climate Change]] that do not require specialisation.
- "Events of National & International Importance"
- "General" Science

The Syllabus for CSAT is given below:
- Comprehension
- Interpersonal Skills including communication skills
- Logical Reasoning
- Decision-making & Problem Solving
- General Mental Ability
- Basic Numeracy - Class X Maths and Data Interpretation.

When discussing syllabus there is a lot of talk about Static & Current subjects - where subjects in Science & Tech, [[International Studies\|International Studies]] among others, you see there is a lot of scope for changes and constant reading which is not the case for Static subjects whose syllabus generally stays the same like History and much of Polity, Geography. It is rare to have a current focus if some event occurs which connects to the past.

## Syllabus for Mains
This is a subjective paper unlike Prelims which was MCQs.
Apart from the Two Language papers which are qualifying in nature & require the candidate to score 90 of 300 for the language ones.

The marking papers which contribute to the Merit List of Recommended Students has 7 papers: Essay, 4 papers for [[General Awareness\|General Studies]] and 2 papers of an Optional Subject of the candidate's choosing.

Language Papers are on English along with any Indian Language as given in the 8th Schedule.
Each includes: [[Precis Writing\|Precis Writing]], Comprehension of given passages, usage & vocabulary along with short essays. The only difference being that in the Indian Language one needs the person to translate from English to regional language.

Syllabus for the 4 GS papers is as follows:

| GS-1                 | GS-2                           | GS-3                                      | GS-4                     |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| [[History\|History]]          | [[Indian Polity & Governance\|Indian Polity & Governance]] | [[Indian Economy\|Indian Economy]] (focus on Agriculture) | Ethical Theories         |
| [[Indian Geography\|Indian Geography]] | Social Issues                  | Environmental Studies                     | Contribution of Thinkers |
| Indian Society       | [[International Studies\|International Studies]]      | [[Science & Technology\|Science & Tech]]  | Applied Ethics           |
|                      |                                | [[Disaster Management\|Disaster Management]]                   | Case Studies             |
|                      |                                | [[Internal Security\|Internal Security]]                     |                          |
There is a lot of overlap between the Mains & Prelims subjects - most aspirants go for learning the first 3 GS papers before studying for GS-4 and lastly they study for their Optional Subjects or keep it up next to Prelims.

### Optional Subjects
Among the Optional Subjects, you have an option to take any two of 26 available subjects and one of the options is also to take "literature" in any one of the 22 scheduled languages as per the [[Eighth Schedule of the Indian Constitution\|Eighth Schedule of the Indian Constitution]]. that means you have a total of 48 subjects. The expectation is to have an Honours Degree level of understanding of the chosen subject (slightly higher than Bachelor's Degree and slightly lesser than Master's Degree).  

The most common subjects include [[Anthropolgy\|Anthropolgy]], [[History\|History]], [[Polical Science\|Polical Science]], [[Sociology\|Sociology]].

The subjects are chosen so for the some reasons: 
1. Subject Affinity: if the person likes the subject or has a bachelor's degree on the subject.
2. Availability of Resources & Books on the subject  
3. Scoring Potential vs Subject Syllabus tradeoff shifts each year but has a few patterns.

It is one of the most important choices one can make on the entire journey of appearing for the exam.

### Mains Interview Pattern/Guidelines
Officially called a "Personality Test" it is different from a QnA session like a Viva where you are answering questions as objectively and factually as possible. In the Mains interview, candidates are first asked to introduce themselves and their background before being grilled about general interests.

Skills judged by the panel are: 
- Critical Powers of Assimilation
- Clarity of Expression
- Balance of Judgement
- Intellectual & Moral Integrity
- Ability of Social Cohesion and Leaderhsip
- Logical Exposition

## Preparation Priority Order
Firstly choose to study the Static Subjects first.
In the subjects wherever possible - we study the NCERTs first, then basic books followed by PYQs and tests while making notes throughout to make revision easier.


## Tips for clearing the exam
1. Please mug up & absolutely memorise the syllabus to the point that you are one with it.
2. Re-read the same books 5 times, 10 times, be absolutely mind-numbingly boring.
3. Do not read 10 books for 1 subject, read 2 books 5 times.
4. Good Answer-Writing technique along with rule 1 is perfect for the job.
5. Mock Interviews are very important.

## Ideal Schedule
If you are preparing full-time, prepare like you are on a job - 8 hours a day for 6 days.
If you are in college or in a full-time job -  3 to 5 hours a day, 8 to 10 hours on weekends.
Aim for 50 hours a week - Overall, bye-bye social life.
