# Technical Intelligence (TECHINT)
> Intelligence Collected from Technological or Technical Sources like: 
> 1. Satellite Imaging (known as [[Imaging Intelligence (IMINT)\|Imaging Intelligence (IMINT)]]), 
> 2. GPS Location and SIM card tracking (example of [[Communication Intelligence (COMINT)\|Communication Intelligence (COMINT)]]), 
> 3. [[Electronic Intelligence (ELINT)\|Electronic Intelligence (ELINT)]] techniques like Radar Signature Spotting
> 4. using [[Spyware\|Spyware]] and [[Cyber Reconnaissance\|Cyber Recon]] technologies like Pegasus on the electronic devices of the target.

To collect most of the IMINT, we can use Google Earth and Google Earth Pro to get best satellite imagery of all parts of the world across different time periods one can select. 

If your agency is government-based then government agencies can use government satellites which were (on the surface) meant for "Earth Exploration" or "Ocean Exploration" either directly or indirectly by checking what kind of data did they publish and optionally (if needed) cultivating a [[Human Intelligence (HUMINT)\|HUMINT]] source.
