# Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)
> Manufacturing Cost of the good sold or services provided by any business. It is the combined cost of all factors affecting production i.e., both [[Direct Cost\|Direct]] and [[Indirect Cost\|Indirect]].

Mathematically, it can be represented by:

<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><a class="markdown-embed-link" href="/direct-cost/#091174" aria-label="Open link"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon lucide-link"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a><div class="markdown-embed">



$\Large\text{Direct Cost} + \text{Indirect Cost} = \text{Cost of Goods Sold}$ 

</div></div>


These are just the cost of manufacturing the product, one still has to market said product, have a sales team that will actively approach potential buyers and [[Sales Conversion\|convert them]] into actual buyers.
