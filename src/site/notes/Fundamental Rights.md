# Fundamental Rights
The Constitution of India provides us (The Citizens) with some Fundamental Rights.
These Fundamental Rights (also shortened to FRs) are based on the U.S Bill of Rights from the Constitution of the United States of America.
The FRs are the part of the Part-III of the Constitution.

# Why are FRs needed?
FRs are the antidote to communalism and casteism (or in-fighting in general) where there was a need to give everyone some levels of equal rights which held every Citizen of India (that is Bharat) equal before the law of this land.
Made to counter the use of State Powers against the State's own subjects (as seen in the British Era and in kingdoms of other invasive forces)

# Terminology related to FRs
Article 12 details the definition of a state for the purposes of FRs and unless, the context otherwise requires or mentions, it includes:
- The Government and The Parliament of India
- The Government and legislature of each of the states
- All local or other authorities within the territory of India or under the control of the Government of India.

Article 13 defines the law in context of the FRs. The term ‘law’ in Article 13 has been given a wide connotation so as to include the following:
- Permanent laws enacted by the Parliament or the state legislatures
- Temporary laws like ordinances issued by the president or the state governors
- Statutory instruments in the nature of delegated legislation (executive legislation) like order, bye-law, rule, regulation or notification
