This is an index note about Geography. If one wants to study the subject this is perfect place for them to start.

### Universe & Creation
- [[Big Bang Theory\|Big Bang Theory]] - the theory of how the universe was created.
- [[Doppler Effect\|Doppler Effect]] - MoM z14 is the oldest galaxy by redshift which proves Big Bang's timeline as false since galaxies like MoM z14 formed just 280 million years after the Big Bang which is 80 million years before the timeline said the galaxies ***started*** consolidating.
- [[Gravitational Waves\|Gravitational Waves]] - waves in space-time sent by blackholes colliding. Theorised in 1915. Measured in 2015.
- [[Nebular Accreation\|Nebular Accreation]]
- [[Composition of Earth\|Composition of Earth]]

### Physical Geography
- [[Climate\|Climate]] and [[Weather\|Weather]] - there are 4 factors of climate, altitude from sea level, distance from sea (continentality) and ocean current temperature (warm ocean currents promote evaporation & rains while cold ocean currents often mean the environment is devoid of rain) 
- [[Ocean Currents\|Ocean Currents]] - definition, warm vs cold currents, factors affecting ocean currents (ocean water upwelling, surface water temperature)
- [[Temperature Pattern on Earth\|Temperature Pattern on Earth]]
- [[Biomes on Earth\|Biomes on Earth]]
- [[Pressure Patterns on Earth\|Pressure Patterns on Earth]] - 
- [[Coriolis Force\|Coriolis Force]] - Force applied from the spinning of Earth
- [[Wind Currents\|Wind Currents]] - Westerly Disturbances, Monsoon Winds
- [[Plate Tectonics\|Plate Tectonics]]
	- [[Djibouti Triple Junction\|Djibouti Triple Junction]] - Junction of Afar Triangle, Nubian Plate and Indian Plate.
- [[Volcanism\|Volcanism]]

### Environmental Geography
- [[Ecosystem\|Ecosystem]]
- [[Biodiversity\|Biodiversity]] - estimates more than 100 million species, discovered 1.5 million.
- [[Keystone Species\|Keystone Species]] - most important species holding up the ecosystem/biodiversity.
- [[Umbrella Species\|Umbrella Species]] - protect this and you can protect the entire ecosystem.
- [[Indicator Species\|Indicator Species]] - Health of the ecosystem can be judged by their health.
- [[Endemic Species\|Endemic Species]] - Species found ONLY in the specific ecosystem
- [[Alien Invasive Species\|Alien Invasive Species]] - Artificially-introduced menace of a species
- [[Flagship Species\|Flagship Species]] - Species that are selected to represent an ecosystem.
- [[Foundational Species\|Foundational Species]] - Species that sustain and form the base of the ecosystem (trees).
- [[Biodiversity Loss\|Biodiversity Loss]]

###  Coordinate Geography
- [[Latitude Lines\|Latitude Lines]]
	- [[Equator Line\|Equator Line]]
	- [[Tropic of Cancer\|Tropic of Cancer]]
	- [[Tropic of Capricorn\|Tropic of Capricorn]]
- [[Longitude Lines\|Longitude Lines]]
