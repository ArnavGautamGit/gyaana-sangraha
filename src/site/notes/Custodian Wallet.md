# Custodian Wallet
> It is a type of Digital Wallet to store [[Cryptocurrency\|Cryptocurrency]] where the keys to access the wallet belong to a custodian organisation (usually the company behind the wallet) holds either some keys, majority keys or all of the keys.

This is the worst kind of Crypto Wallet and using it basically invites companies like FDX to run away with your money, like FDX ran away with user's money in 2022.

Always store your [[Cryptocurrency\|Crypto]] in [[Non-Custodian Wallet\|Non-Custodian Wallet]]
