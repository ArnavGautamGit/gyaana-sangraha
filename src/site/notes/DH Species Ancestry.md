# DH Species Ancestry
In [[Daggerheart\|Daggerheart]], there are many different Species/Races that exist. It is interesting to note that there is an assumption that all species/races speak a common language and hence there are no language rules in the game. The Sign Language is also Universal and understood by everyone.

It is upto the GM if they want to hombrew languages for regions or races or if they wish to have the languages be known or everyone uses magic to understand each other regardless of language.

Each Species/Race has a specific set of advantages it provides. They are mentioned in the notes, but please prefer any information on Demiplane over these notes.

The List of Species/Races in [[Daggerheart\|Daggerheart]] are:
- [[Clank (DH)\|Clank (DH)]] - the automaton or robot like beings in Fantasy
