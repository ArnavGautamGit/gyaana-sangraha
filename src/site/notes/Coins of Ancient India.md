# Coins of Ancient India
> Note that lists all the different kinds of coins popular throughout the [[Ancient Indian History\|Ancient Indian History]] and could be found and recorded. New findings may change the current knowledge we have.

The list of coins are divided among periods, although at the time of writing, the notes are not as extensive as [[Major Inscriptions of Ancient India\|Major Inscriptions of Ancient India]].

### Mauryan-Sātavāhana Period Coins
We were able to find [[Kārṣāpaṇa Coins\|Kārṣāpaṇa Coins]] which were punch-marked coins made of Silver or Alloy of silver with other metals and were also called Aahat coins which were made by stamping a symbol on the silver piece cut in a square or circular shape. It had markings to confirm the legitimacy of the coins.

[[Mauryan Empire\|Mauryan Empire]] issued Silver and Copper based Karsapanas. Alloys were used rarely for lowest denomination coins. Gold was used only as premium treasury in the form of bricks. 
[[Sātavāhana Empire\|Sātavāhana Empire]] used Silver, Copper, Lead & Potin Coins since they did not have access to Gold from Central Asian regions like Bactria.


### Kushan Period Coins
Indo-Greek Kingdoms like the [[Kushan Empire\|Kushan Empire]] and its vassal kingdoms used Gold coins. 
Coins made from Gold were popular form of payment in Central Asian region and the Kushans using Gold as a medium of coinage meant we had great relations with Central Asia and Kushans themselves had captured Central Asian regions too! Apart from Gold, other coins made of Copper were also used for lower denominations.

Kushan Empire's Gold Coins had highest purity of Gold & Copper suggesting high monetisation and a strong inflow of Gold into India from Central Asia. Many later kingdoms could not get the same purity of Gold as the Kushans!
