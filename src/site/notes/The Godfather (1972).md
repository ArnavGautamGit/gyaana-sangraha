# The Godfather (1972)
> These are the class notes I made in [[Literature & Adaptation\|Literature & Adaptation]] class when we were taught about the making of this movie as an adaptation to the book. For the actual note on the movie & my review, please see the note: [[The Godfather Part 1\|The Godfather Part 1]].

These notes are primarily made from an academic viewpoint to finish my classes with a good grade - not necessarily to be put online like this. This is a request not to take these notes as any direct/indirect way of condoning criminal gangs & the violence committed by them.

### Various Families in The Godfather (1972)
[[The Corleone Family.canvas|The Corleone Family]] - the strongest family at the start of the film.
The Tattaglia Family
The Stracci Family
The Cuneo Family
The Barazzi Family - formerly the strongest.

### Symbolism
- Windows: Signifying hope and opportunity to turn this family "business" legitimate one day. Hope that they'll always live as happily as they were at Connie's wedding.
- Doors: Hiding things and keeping them hidden. Including the Family Business.
- Chairs: Power and Authority.
- Passing the baton: In the final moments as the door is closing on Kay, we can faintly hear the visitors call Michael as "Don Corleone" - something only Vito was addressed as until now.

### Foreshadowing & Things I noticed
- Vito talking of giving Carlo a job but then never actually doing it - foreshadowing Carlo's betrayal.
- Before Vito died playing with Michael's son Anthony in their tomato field, he told Michael "whoever comes to you for Barzini meeting is a traitor, don't forget that". Tessio approached Michael for the said meeting on Vito's funeral just days later... Vito is the real Don.
- At the start of the story, Michael wears a different colour than the Family - brown vs black. When they are planning to kill Sollozzo and Captain McClusky, he is still wearing brown. The day he is about to execute the plan is the first day he wears black - signalling he is in the family's "business" now even when Sonny is still alive!
- Throughout the time Sonny is the patriarch of the family, he is wearing lesser layers. He is always shown in a shirt with a waistcoat. Michael is always wearing a waistcoat, coat and then an overcoat... subtly signalling how Michael is exposed and vulnerable not to mention straight-forward and no-filter kind of a person. Michael is very calculating, very much layered. Audience almost never knows what he is thinking. Moments before Michael leaves to kill Sollozzo and McClusky, Sonny is in an undershirt - ever so vulnerable... even Vito was wearing less layers than usual right before he was shot.
