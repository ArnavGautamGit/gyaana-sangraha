# Event-based Adventure
> An Adventure or Campaign based around or triggered by a large event which changes the situation drastically or threatens the same. The event may be a [[Cataclysmic Event\|Cataclysmic Event]] or be rather mundane like an [[Invasion\|Invasion]]

Such adventures need to be made with the [[Framing Event\|Framing Event]] and the [[Antagonist\|Antagonist]] in mind. 
Creating a world around the problems created by these and the party wondering about how to solve or stop them? Does solving the problems even stop the Anatgonist? Will the plan of killing the antagonist even makes the villainy stop? Is there a larger villain?

Identify any important [[Non-Player Character\|NPCs]] and have them meet the party at a set location propel the party in the right direction. [[RPG Encounters\|RPG Encounters]] can be used for the same.
