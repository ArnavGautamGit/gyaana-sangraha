# My Samsung Galaxy Tab A
This note marks the repair history of my Tab.
It was originally bought due to a partnership pf FIITJEE where FIITJEE would host their test series.
I stil have the cover given by them.
The Tab stopped turning on in some time near 2021-22. When it was sparsely being used and spent most of its time in the cupboard.

I got it repaired from "Divine Galaxy e-Services" repair store. I sent it to them around 26th May 2024 at 7PM (according to the Job Sheet Invoice they gave me)

The tab was sent back once for heating on & around a black spot in the display.
The tab was given back after "fixing" the issue on 21st June 2024 12 PM but some heating still persisted.
After testing the tab as much as we could (since we are not professional testers) it was decided that we pay the amount payable and keep it nonetheless & use it as much as we can in its last few days.

The Invoice is given below

We got an undertaking signed by the delivery executive regarding the heating issue behind the same invoice page and I scanned that as well.
