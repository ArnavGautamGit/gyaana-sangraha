# Providence
> In Meditations, the concept of Providence is mentioned multiple times over and over. Providence is often also showcased in media as something that controls the things from outside the reach of the characters at play. In Marcus Aurelius's Eyes, ***Providence is the purposeful order of the Universe, which goes as per the Divine Logic (logos) of the Gods***. 

Although he mentions it in Book 1 of [[Meditations\|Meditations]], but he does not mention it until the 3rd Verse of Book 2.
> [!quote] *Meditations - Book 2, Verse 3*
> *"Whatever Gods ordain is full of wise forethought. The workings of chance are not apart from nature, and not without connexion and intertexture with the designs of Providence. Providence is the source of all things; and besides, there is necessity, and the the Utility of the Universe, of which you are a part. For every part of a being, that is good which springs from the nature of the whole and tends to its preservation. Now, the order of Nature is preserved in the changes of the elements, just as it is in the changes of things that compound. Let this suffice you, and be your creed unchangable. Put from you the thirst of books, that you may not die murmuring, but meekly, and true and heartfelt gratitude to the Gods"*
> ~ Marcus Aurelius

Marcus claims that whatever happens - happens for a reason and the reason is beyond the understanding of humans since the Universe often has to see to the preservation of every part of the being (i.e., every part of God i.e., the universe needs to look out for each Human) and hence every action you do has a ripple effect in the lives of the people around you - which effects the people around them. A small change in your life can create a domino effect of a big change in someone else's so it is important to know that whatever happened has happened for a reason - either plan according to the will of the Universe (Providence) or make yourself worthy for a Divine Intervention from the Gods. 

Marcus argues that since it is in the nature of the Universe to do what is necessitated by the Gods, Providence is a part of Nature - and Nature can never be evil. Hence if the Providence acts against you and gives you hardship in life - it is so that you learn from it and move ahead in life with the aim of becoming stronger until times get better.

The final lines give an example of the fact that the Providence (Will of the Universe) is the one that puts the idea of reading and learning in your head - so that you do not die muttering but die peacefully. The term "die muttering" is a phrase which describes how a person usually is muttering and praying to the Gods when laying on the pillory in front of the executioner - moments before their head is chopped off for a crime. Marcus means to say that the Universe wills it that you learn about the world so that you become better than a petty criminal or one could say that the Universe wills you to read about the law so you can avoid breaking it.
