# Conditions for Molecular Energy Transfer
For Energy Transfer to take place between two bodies, the frequency of the incoming energy source must match the [[Lattice Vibration Frequency\|Lattice Vibration Frequency]] or [[Bond Vibration Frequency\|Bond Vibration Frequency]] for the energy to actually transfer. That is, there must be [[Resonance\|Resonance]] of Frequencies.

Atmospheric Energy Transfer here is used to describe that the transfer of energy from Sunlight to atmospheric gasseous molecules and the resulting Greenhouse effect of capturing energy. For this type of Energy Transfer, there is another condition that the atmospheric molecules must showcase [[Infrared Activity\|Infrared Activity]] since the atmosphere is transparent to Visible light - it shows refraction and scattering but so does a glass slab.

The conditions for Mechanical Energy Transfer or Kinetic Energy Transfer may be different.
