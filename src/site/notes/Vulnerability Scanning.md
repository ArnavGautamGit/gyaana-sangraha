# Vulnerability Scanning
> Identifies [[Cyber Security Terminology#Vulnerabilities\|vulnerabilities]] and weaknesses of a system and network in order to determine how a system can be exploited.

Time has come to use all the data we collected earlier to figure out which vulnerabilities might exist and we can leverage the underwritten tools to make that job easier if predicting on the basis of theory is hard.
1. Nessus
2. GFI LanGuard
3. Nikto
4. Retina CS
5. SAINT

The list will get too long if we try to write down all the tools available.
