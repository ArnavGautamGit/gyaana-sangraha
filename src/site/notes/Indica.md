# Indica
> Book written by [[Megasthenes\|Megasthenes]] of the [[Selucid Empire\|Selucid Empire]] when he came to India (ruled by [[Mauryan Empire\|Mauryan Empire]]) during [[Chandragupta Maurya\|Chandragupta Maurya]]'s reign.

[[Megasthenes\|Megasthenes]] was a Greek and wrote in slight hyperbolic terms which was the way of writing at the time - since people wanted to convey the emotions felt at the time instead of exact historic facts which were harder to compile. His writings were concern for debate and controversy in contemporary Rome and today alike.

### Writings & Origin
[[Megasthenes\|Megasthenes]] was sent to [[Mauryan Empire\|Mauryan Empire]] ("India" as per contemporary texts) to document the happenings by [[Selucus I Nicator\|Selucus I Nicator]] after the Selcuid loss across wars with Mauryans from 305 to 303 BC & the eventual signing of [[The Treaty of The Indus (303 BC)\|The Treaty of The Indus (303 BC)]].

### Controversial Writings
There were a few things Megasthenes wrote that are either not cross-verified by other sources or outright contradicted by other contemporary sources. Since he talked about India, it is natural that historians give the Indian sources more weightage.

For example: Megasthenes noted that there are 7 social classes in India, whereas we know that in Hinduism (which was the dominant religion at the time) there are only 4 classes/castes of people & [[Bauddha (Buddhism)\|Buddhism]] also uses the same 4 castes.

Other claims that were not mentioned by any other contemporary source were the claims regarding India having "no slavery" and City Adminisitration having 6 councils of 5 people each - both of which are not written on Indian sides at all. 

My peronal theory here is that due to slavery being against common humanitarian sense and individual cities having different customs since city administration was not covered in the [[Saptﾄ］ga Theory\|Saptﾄ］ga Theory]] & [[Kautilya Arthashﾄ《tra\|Kautilya Arthashﾄ《tra]] as far as my knowledge goes. (although I could be wrong) Slavery is different from the King having servants & the like because the latter are basically paid employees who also existed in slavery-free societies of the time.
