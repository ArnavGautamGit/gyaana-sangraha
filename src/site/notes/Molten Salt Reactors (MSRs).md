# Molten Salt Reactors (MSRs)
Here, the [[Fissile Material\|Fissile Material]] is kept in its molten salt, which constantly repurposes the fuel and reduces [[Nuclear Waste\|Nuclear Waste]].
It can use both [[Thorium\|Thorium]] and [[Uranium\|Uranium]] for Fissile Materials.

It can help in my quest to find a new, sustainable, Wasteless reaction for my [[Simulating Zero-Waste Nuclear Reactions\|Simulating Zero-Waste Nuclear Reactions]] research project.
