# 2024 UEFA Champions League Cheating Incident
In The Champions Semi-Final, [[FC Bayern München\|FC Bayern München]] (also FC Bayern Munich or FC Bayern) were cheated by not being given an equaliser, the [[Assistant Referee\|Lineman]] gave the equalising goal as an offside even though it wasn't an offside. VAR was not checked despite the protest from the players.

The lineman later admitted that he made a mistake and Matthis De Ligt, who is a player for FC Bayern called out the same, quoting the lineman. {sources: [[Real Madrid - The Cheating Fucks#^1\|#^1]], [[Real Madrid - The Cheating Fucks#^2\|#^2]]}
Being polite he said that he would not blame the referee but we all know how comptetant FIFA and their referees are.

According to the regular protocol, The Lineman is supposed to keep the flag down and allow the attacking play to play out before raising the flags - to keep buffer for a VAR review and avoid human error (which the lineman admitted to the players of making). Even the Bayern Manager, Thomas Tuchel did not take this nicely {source: [[Real Madrid - The Cheating Fucks#^3\|#^3]]}

> "The linesman says sorry but that does not help. To raise the flag in a moment like this... The referee sees we get the second ball and we get the shot - it’s a very, very bad decision. It’s against the rules. It’s a disaster. It’s hard to swallow but that’s the way it is.”

> ~ FC Bayern München's Manager, Thomas Tuchel (in a post-match interview)

It is imperative to note that the Spanish competitions want Real Madrid to win. This being a match played in Madrid is obviously a goal which is denied due to bias towards the Spanish team in the Spanish Capital city! Else why would the Spanish League ([[La Liga\|La Liga]]) not level the same allegations and charges (including the sanctions) on [[FC Barcelona\|FC Barcelona]] before stalwarts like [[Lionel Messi\|Lionel Messi]], [[Jordi Alba\|Jordi Alba]], [[Suarez\|Suarez]] left the team & the team was reduced to nothing? Because it was bringing ratings via the El Classico which is now no longer competitive.
Barça may still have the likes of [[Lamine Yamal\|Lamine Yamal]] and [[Lewandowski\|Lewandowski]] but we all know that it is nothing in front of the likes of [[Toni Kroos\|Toni Kroos]], [[Jude Bellingham\|Jude Bellingham]], [[Vinicius Jr.\|Vinicius Jr.]], [[Rodrygo\|Rodrygo]], [[Camavinga\|Camavinga]], [[Eder Militão\|Eder Militão]], [[Rüdiger\|Rüdiger]] among others!

The match needs to be redone or the goal needs to be given due to intervention otherwise it is best that the English and the Germans should just move out of the Champions League in its entirety. There is no need to take part in it when you are champions of Europe when you win the Europa anyway...

Real Madrid are cheaters and shall go down in History as so.

Further, these cheating fucks even cheated in the Final against [[Borussia Dortmund (BVB)\|Borussia Dortmund (BVB)]]. The Yellow Cards were only flying towards Dortmund players for apparently nothing, to the point that there were more yellow cards than the players you can substitute.
Mendy pushed a Dortmund player down when both of them were inside the Penalty Box - this should have warranted a yellow card and a Penalty Kick but it didn't apparently...

[[Vinicius Jr.\|Vinicius Jr.]] tackled the Dortmund Goalkeeper - Kobel & then got a reluctant Yellow Card from the referee (should have gotten a red card). Due to this error Vini later even scored for the Madrid Cheating Fucks.

Players from the spanish cheating team such as [[Carvajal\|Carvajal]] also scored after they had been acting like absolute drama queens, they were diving at every step and even manhandled & pushed around Malen in front of the referee even then there was no card given to the Madrid Cheaters for the reason that Madrid has bought the referees.
