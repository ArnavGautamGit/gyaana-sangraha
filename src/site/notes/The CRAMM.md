# The CRAMM
> CRAMM is a short for "**C**CTA **R**isk **A**nalysis and **M**anagement **M**ethod" and it was developed by the [[CCTA\|CCTA]]

$$\large Risk = (Threat \ Rating) \times (Vulnerability \ Value) \times (Asset \ Rating)$$

It is considered an improvement over [[The OWASP Method\|The OWASP Method]] since it acknowledges that individual assets can have differing values and some assets combined can seldom be of a smaller value than one big asset.

***Threat Rating*** can go from Very Low (VL) to Very High (VH).
***Vulnerability Value*** can go from Low (L) to High (H).
***Asset Rating*** is given by the organisation on a scale of 1 to 10.
