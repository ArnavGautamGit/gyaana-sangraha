# My Digital Library
Only includes summaries and notes from Books & eBooks read after 1st January 2024.
Greyed out link are books that I own but I have not started reading yet.
I may skip Fiction Books notes entirely and may even delete the listing.

On clicking on an individual book's name you will find all my learnings from the books. Take them as things that I have discovered. To re-iterate what was written from the Homepage, I am not afraid of offending people in my quest of truth - because to find the answers you often need to ask questions regardless of how hard, offensive or taboo they may be considered.
