# Secure Design of Software Systems
> Subject in 7th semester of my B.Tech Computer Science Degree which combines [[Cyber Security Principles\|Cyber Security Principles]] with [[Software Engineering\|Software Engineering]].

Subject is taught by Professor Shruti Jaiswal who is one of the few good professors in whatever department this subject falls under. She is ready to explain the same thing again and has knowledge of her subject. She will grant you a free period if the class says they don't feel like studying - she will also tell the students to get the attendance and leave to focus on revision in classes right before exams. 

Her Teaching ability is amazing. Although other professors such as Ashish Sir also have a great teaching ability, their behaviour with other kids of making them stand in the side if they have come late did not sit well with any student.
