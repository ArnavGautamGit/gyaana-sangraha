# Ikigai (Japanese Concept)
> *Ikigai* is a concept with Japanese Origins which is written as "生き甲斐" where the combination of the first two Kanji letters "生き" mean "Iki" (Life) and the following two Kanji letters "甲斐" mean "gai" (to be worthwhile) 
> The meaning is clear - Ikigai refers to something that makes our life worthwhile. It is unique for everyone

In the book, "[[Ikigai - The Japanese Secret to a Long and Happy Life\|Ikigai - The Japanese Secret to a Long and Happy Life]]" the authors have provided a Venn Diagram. Reading the book would be an \[optional\] pre-requisite.

According to this Venn Diagram, the intersection of the following:
1. What one loves (their likes)
2. What one is good at (their strengths) 
3. What one can be paid for (their skills)
4. What the world needs (problems they can solve)

My major criticism of the book (as voiced [[Ikigai - The Japanese Secret to a Long and Happy Life#Some Criticism\|here]]) is that the part of how one discovers their Ikigai was not mentioned, the only thing in that chapter was this Venn Diagram and the starting definition block (which is also altered to be easy to understand). The book quickly moved towards "how to live long using Ikigai as a tool".

This prompted me to go on my own [[Journey to Discover My Personal Ikigai\|Journey to Discover My Personal Ikigai]].

This is very similar to the Concept of [[Dharma (धर्म)\|Dharma (धर्म)]] although Dharma is a spiritual concept instead of a material one but it also describes what path one should take regardless of if you are facing hard times or not. In this aspect, I would say that Dharma is more similar to [[Bushido (Samurai Code)\|Bushido (Samurai Code)]] than Ikigai.
