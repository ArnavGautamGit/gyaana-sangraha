# Money
> A medium of exchange used to map & pay the value of a product as a part of some [[Financial Transaction\|Financial Transaction]].

Earlier we used to barter for goods & needed a double-coincidence of wants i.e., both parties need to have an Intrinsic [[Demand\|Demand]] for the item the other person is selling. This was an extremely specific scenario hence commodity money was used (a commodity which everyone wants) which could be grain or metals like Gold.

Eventually, the first piece of Metallic Money were old coins similar to India's [[Kārṣāpaṇa Coins\|Kārṣāpaṇa Coins]] but they were being counterfeited and making more complex coins to avoid counterfeiting became a cat & mouse game. Apart from counterfeiting, the bigger problem was people melting the coins for getting metal for personal use.

Nowadays, we use Token Money, coins & notes which cost a lot less to manufacture than their inherent cost of components. For example, a 10 rupee coin is made of nickel and tin worth a few paisa.

[[Counterfeit Money\|Counterfeit Money]] still exists but it is not as big of a problem anymore. Apart from a few regions like Italy's Scarfati and also Pakistan (obviously).

[[Counterfeit Money\|Counterfeit Money]] can be stopped by [[Plastic Money\|Plastic Money]] and [[Digital Financial Transactions\|Digital Financial Transactions]] like [[National Electronic Financial Transactions (NEFT)\|NEFT]], [[Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS)\|RTGS]], [[Instant Money Payment System (IMPS)\|IMPS]], [[Unified Payment Interface (UPI)\|UPI]]. Although there is also [[Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC)\|Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC)]] which is the digital form of Currency.

[[Plastic Money\|Plastic Money]] refers to Debit & Credit Cards made by [[VISA\|VISA]], [[MasterCard\|MasterCard]] and [[RuPay\|RuPay]] Card Networks. These Card Networks earn by taking a convenience cut from the transaction named [[Merchant Discount Rate (MDR)\|Merchant Discount Rate (MDR)]].
The cash currency notes made with plastic are called [[Plastic Currency\|Plastic Currency]].
I have made a chart explaining how this works via [[Card Transactions.canvas\|Card Transations Explained]] Canvas Note (canvas notes are not accessible by the website).
