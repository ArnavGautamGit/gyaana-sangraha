# Cost of General Overheads
> These are costs that are part of the [[Economics of any Business\|regular functioning of any business]] at any given time but cannot be attributed SOLELY to any ONE of the other types of costs that a business may encounter such as [[Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)\|COGS]] or [[Sales & Marketing Costs\|Sales & Marketing Costs]].

It is important to note that any specific overheads such as the bills as incurred by the specific department (like Marketing) goes into their own specific costs. The Departments are then categorised into whether they go into [[Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)\|COGS]], [[Sales & Marketing Costs\|S&M Costs]] or [[Cost of General Overheads\|General Overhead Costs]].

General Overheads may include the following:
- Salaries of Senior Management (like the CEO)
- Salaries of the HR, Finance and other common departments
- Electricity, Food, Water or other Bills of appliances that were shared across different departments. 
	- Sometimes bills cannot be calculated for individual departments.
- Other overheads like lawn maintainance
- Every other bill that has NOT yet been accounted for in any other costs
