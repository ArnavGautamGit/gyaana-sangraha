# Brahma Vaishnava
> One of the Four Traditional Roots of the [[Vaishnava Tradition of Hinduism\|Vaishnava Tradition of Hinduism]] which is also one of the fastest growing ones in regions outside India - particularly the West.

Many popular vaishnava sampradāya like [[Gaudiya Vaishnava Sampradāya\|Gaudiya Vaishnava]] and the [[Haridāsa Sampradāya\|Haridāsa Sampradāya]] have branched out from this very root. Many popular international organisations like [[ISKCON\|ISKCON]] are a part of this fold since their tradition is a part of the [[Gaudiya Vaishnava Sampradāya\|Gaudiya Vaishnava Sampradāya]].

### Two Siddhantas
There are two siddhantas for sampradāya in this fold. Some follow the [[Dvaita Vedānta\|Dvaita Vedānta]] while others follow [[Achintya Bhedābheda\|Achintya Bhedābheda]]. So one will have to look into the details of each Sampradāya within this root fold to see which [[Vedānta\|Vedānta]] philosophy do they subscribe to as their siddhanta (foundational philosophic doctrine).
