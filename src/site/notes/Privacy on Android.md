# Privacy on Android
> A note that build upon [[Mobile Phone Privacy\|Mobile Phone Privacy]] using software specific instructions for [[Android OS\|Android OS]] and supporting Android devices from Pixels to Motorolas. 

This guide assumes that you have read and religiously followed [[Personal Online Privacy\|Personal Online Privacy]] and [[Mobile Phone Privacy\|Mobile Phone Privacy]] as much as possible and want to look towards actionable software steps for your phone/tablet.

### Steps to Reduce Tracking
Firstly, recheck the tracking settings via Settings > Privacy > Ads.
Here we exercise our option to "Delete Advertising ID" completely from this device. Note that the ads you see may still be affected by the apps you have on your phone.

Secondly, open settings and go to Security & Privacy > Privacy > Permissions Manager
Here we check all permissions you have for microphone, camera and location - including any permissions to get Precise Location and remove all apps that get your location all the time and change it to "Ask Every Time" or "Don't Allow". Rethink using that app if it does not have either of those settings. Use Organic Maps instead of Google Maps or even get a dedicated GPS or Navigation Unit for your car.

Thirdly, In Settings > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Privacy Dashboard
Here we recheck our permissions and if they have taken effect. Go ahead and feell free to delete apps that do not acknowledge your supremacy. If [[Android OS\|Android OS]] is being a bitch about permissions, feel free to backup your device and consider the move to [[Graphene OS\|Graphene OS]].

Fourthly, keep in mind you can disable location access across apps if you use the following setup found in:  Settings > Location > turn off "Use Location". Note that since this is an OS owned by Google (one of the worst in big tech, I would not trust them anyway and move to [[Graphene OS\|Graphene OS]] for personal use while my work & bank phone might be an iPhone)

### Turn off Web & App Activity
1. Open Settings > Google > Manage your Google Account
2. Tap Data & Privacy
3. Under "History & Settings" tap "Web & App Activity"
4. Turn off Web & App Activity
5. Consider selecting "Turn off and Delete Activity"

### Turn off Google Maps Timeline
Go to your Google Account and go to the Timeline Section of your Google Account before turning it off, it theoretically turns off background location capture and storage everytime you fire up Google Maps. Your "Google Maps Digest" emails will showcase whether this is working properly or not.

When Timeline is on, Google can see:
1. Signals like Wi-Fi & Mobile Data Networks
2. GPS Location
3. Sensor Information
4. This Data may update in the background periodically.

### Turn off YouTube History for Ads
Make sure to turn off ***BOTH*** Search & Watch History when you are at it & set to delete every XYZ time - preferably the smallest time window available - this might not remove your data but since your history is off anyway and you unsubscribe from all subscriptions you are perfectly clean from ad history. See a new upto-date Tutorial online since Google does not want you do this & keep changing the position of this setting and even dividing the data among different webpages.

It is a good advice to ditch YouTube for New Pipe if you can from their [GitHub repo](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe).
