# Hidden (DH)
> A condition or state in [[Compendiums/Daggerheart Compendium/Daggerheart\|Daggerheart]] where any given creature is hidden from a set of other creatures.

It is not necesary that the hidden creature be hidden from all of the others.
Some classes like [[Compendiums/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Classes/Rogue (DH)\|Rogue (DH)]] may gain some kind advantage over adversaries while in this state.
