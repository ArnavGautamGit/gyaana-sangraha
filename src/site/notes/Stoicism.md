# Stoicism - My limited understanding
> An [[Ancient Greece\|Ancient Greek]] Philosphical perspective which says that we can follow our desires and enjoy the pleasures as long as they don't start to control us.

The Stoics believed frivolous desires such as sex and luxury are useless. The objective must be mental growth (and by extension, spiritual growth). Once that happens you would not need to chase the two actively. They will be a byproduct of your success. 

The Stoics strive to answer "What is the worst that can happen?" and then prepared for that.

They believed in remaining neutral emotinally and review our actions and choices after every victory or defeat. This is a common thread it shares with the [[Shrimad-Bhagavad Gītā\|Shrimad-Bhagavad Gītā]] (exact quote to be linked when I finish reading the Gītā).
