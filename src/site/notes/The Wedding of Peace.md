# The Wedding of Peace
> Event in [[Lurov\|Lurov]] that cemented the [[Kingdom of Dragonpeaks\|Kingdom of Dragonpeaks]] as the undisputed greatest power & things would remained so if [[The Raebershire Rebellion\|The Raebershire Rebellion]] did NOT occur.

There was a tussle of power in the eastern regions of the Dragonpeaks mountain range with things like cross border spying being normal between [[Owlesia\|Owlesia]] and [[Kingdom of Dragonpeaks\|Kingdom of Dragonpeaks]].

It was like a cold war, the Owlesian General [[Edward Nightingale\|Edward Nightingale]] was able to build a new contraption, a design of massive crossbows that could shoot arrows from a repeating magazine - specifically made by the Giants & Dwarves of Owlesia to take out Dragons.

The Cold War stopped when the two kingdoms wee forced to work together to stop the proxy wars in [[Magical Woods\|Magical Woods]] when the Simiah were being lured by the [[Miragerie\|Miragerie]] and the Orcs even took quite a lot of land in the south of the Woods setting up new cities in the east.

Realising that they would have to join forces to counter balance the [[Miragerie\|Miragerie]], it was decided that Queen [[Ivara II Bronze\|Ivara II Bronze]] of Dragonpeaks would marry the King of Owlesia [[John VI Forechester\|John VI]]. Both Monarchs would rule together as equals - an exception made for this generation only. Another exception was that if either of the monarchs pass, the kingdom would be ruled by the other monarch.
