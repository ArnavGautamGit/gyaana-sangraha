# Gross Margin
> Defined as the total margin on manufacturing cost a business earns when selling a product. It is important to note that [[Sales & Marketing Costs\|Sales & Marketing Costs]] are not included here.

It is calculated by using the following formula:
$$\Large \text{Net Revenue} - \text{Cost of Goods Sold} = \text{Gross Margin}$$
This is further used to calculate the business's [[EBITDA\|EBITDA]] - which is one of the most important terms in business.

### Gross Margin vs Gross Profit
Many Financial Systems use a different term for the difference of [[Net Revenue\|Net Revenue]] and [[Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)\|COGS]] known as "Gross Profit" and use the conventional term "Gross Margin" specifically as the ratio of Gross Profit and Net Revenue depicted as a percentage.
$$\Large \text{Net Revenue} - \text{Cost of Goods Sold} = \text{Gross Profit}$$
$$\Large \dfrac{\text{Gross Profit}}{\text{Net Revenue}} \times 100 = \text{Gross Margin}$$
In most financial systems, Gross Margin is accepted as both a numeric value and a percentage value. [[Economics of any Business\|Economics of any Business]] depends upon Gross Profit & Margin
