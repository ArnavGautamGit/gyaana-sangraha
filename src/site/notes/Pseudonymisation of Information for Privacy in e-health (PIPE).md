# Pseudonymisation of Information for Privacy in e-health (PIPE)
> A [[Data Pseudonymisation\|Data Pseudonymisation]] technique which does not hurt [[Data Privacy\|Data Privacy]] since the Pseudonyms cannot be predicted.

Itis important to not that een with psudonymisation, there is still a need for a very basic amount of [[Data Anonymisation\|Data Anonymisation]] where Primary Identifiers (such as name and address) are removed.

### History & Need
Healthcare was (and still is) a domain which required a lot of transparency between healthcare provider and the patient without compromising on the patient's [[Data Privacy\|privacy]].

As Doctors and Researchers needed to research about correlation between a particular attribute (such as eating habits) and the chances of contracting a chronic disease (like Cancer), it was needed that the dataset contained some personal information (not possible without looking past the [[Data Privacy\|Data Privacy]] of the patient)

With Technology, [[Electronic Health Records (EHR)\|Electronic Health Records (EHR)]] have become popular to a point when they are almost a necessity. We need PIPE more than ever.

### Working
It borrows the concept from [[Substitution-based Ciphers\|Substitution-based Ciphers]] where the [[Key\|Key]] is a simple collection of Pseudonyms used to replace respective attributes that the Pseudonyms pertain to.

Anyone, be it the attacker or the researcher can only see the Pseudonymised Data and cannot identify, trace or trouble the original data.
