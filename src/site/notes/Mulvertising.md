# Mulvertising
> Process of injecting Malware into a person's device by using clickable online advertisements of [[Scareware\|Scareware]] or other Malware using Scareware tactics.

The difference between the two is that Scareware is not necessarily coming from advertisements only. Many [[Rootkit (Malware)\|Rootkits]] and [[Computer Virus\|Virus]] (other [[Computer Malware\|Malware]]) are spread through Mulvertising as seen on piracy websites.

### Working
Criminals embed mallicious code into the ads which then appear on the legitimate website. Code is hidden as images, videos which appear over the UI as popups. They hide or fake the "close" button so that you download malware or malicious browser extensions.

### Protection & Prevention
- Using a smart internet browser which is capable of removing untrustworthy extensions.
- Reset Browser Settings.
- Run Security Checks more often.
