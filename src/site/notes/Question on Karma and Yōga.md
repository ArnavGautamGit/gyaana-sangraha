# Question on Karma and Yōga
God Krishna says that one should do their work with utmost determination, love and care - so much so that it becomes [[Yōga\|Yōga]]. 

If one is stuck in a career which they do not enjoy since they were forced into it or attracted into it and they realise that this career is not for them, if they work with the determination as if this is not work but Yōga, that thing that they want to leave will become their career...

I guess, if you do not love something from your heart/core, you can never make the work ([[Karma\|Karma]]) become a [[Yōga\|Yōga]] since somewhere in the back of your mind you are not giving your 100%.
