# How Native American Culture was wiped by the White Christian Europeans
The author J. Sai Deepak cites a Peruvian Sociologist [[Aníbal Quijano\|Aníbal Quijano]] & other scholars such as [[Sylvia Wynter\|Sylvia Wynter]], [[Walter D. Mignolo\|Walter D. Mignolo]], [[Catherine E. Walsh\|Catherine E. Walsh]], [[Nelson Maldonaldo-Torres\|Nelson Maldonaldo-Torres]] and [[Ramón Grosfoguel\|Ramón Grosfoguel]] who presented the thought that the European destruction of Native Americans was through theobject of coloniality - the mindset that drives colonialism.

Using Coloniality, the colonizer uses time, space, subjectivity and makes them exclusive to themselves & their context only - i.e., the coloniser judges themselves by intention - using time and subjectivity of the situation as a scapegoat to say "we did not have any other choice" while any similar attempt from the natives is termed as "propaganda" & hence relegated to the sidelines.

Whenever the trope of "we didn't have any other choice" comes into the picture then the classic [[White Man's Burden of Civilising The World\|White Man's Burden of Civilising The World]] comes to the fore! That it is somehow their burden placed upon them by their [[God in Christianity\|Christian God]] that they are suppose to civilise the world since [[Christianity Equates non-Christians to Beasts without souls\|Christianity Equates non-Christians to Beasts without souls]].

From here, we can breakdown the [[European Method of Colonisation\|European Method of Colonisation]]
