# D&D Multiclassing Rules
> A method to have multiple classes for the same character by taking levels in another available class (given that you can fulfil ability score pre-requisites) instead of the same class.

Note: Character Level is a sum of the levels in each of your classes and it is capped at 20. Taking 5 levels in another class means forgoing the Tier 4 abilities, spells and features of the existing class/classes.

### Hit Points & Hit Dice
Hit Points and Hit Dice  work the same way. They are additive. If a player is playing a Fighter/Barbarian of level 10 with 5 levels in each class, they have 5d10 and 5d12 hit dice whose maximum values are counted for each level they have gained in the said class. In essence they have a total of: $\large (5\times 10) + (5\times 12) =110$ Hit Points.

Mathematically, if a character is multiclassing from C1 to C2, then:
$$\Large Hit \ Points = x\times C1 + y\times C2$$
Here, 
$C1 =$ Maximum Value of 1 Hit Dice of Class 1
$C2 =$ Maximum Value of 1 Hit Dice of Class 2
$\large x =$ Levels gained in Class 1.
$\large y=$ Levels gained in Class 2.
