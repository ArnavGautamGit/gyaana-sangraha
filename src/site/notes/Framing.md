# Framing
> A Technique to structure and phrase the words & sentences differently to sound different. Sometimes with an ulterior motive.

Extensively used in literature (especially Thriller and Crime genres) to frame the murder and situation in a way that only leaks certain part to the reader on a need-to-know basis so that there is no way to predict the story and it remains engaging from cover to cover.
