# Eternal Cities of India - Historical Indian Cities where Civilisation always flourished!

> There were certain Cities which were considered Eternal (Ever-populated) in our Indic Culture. It is said that since these cities were always inhabited since the dawn of time & they have never become ghost towns. 

Our Shāstra (शास्त्र, scriptures) predict that these cities would never become "Ghost Towns" even till the end of times since they hold immense cultural, geographical and economic value in the Indian Civilisation...

The list of these Eternal Cities:
1. [[Madurai - मदुरै \|Madurai - मदुरै ]]
2. [[Ujjain - उज्जैन\|Ujjain - उज्जैन]] 
3. [[Pātliputra - पाटलीपुत्र\|Pātliputra - पाटलीपुत्र]] (now Patna)
4. [[Indraprastha - इन्द्रप्रस्थ\|Indraprastha - इन्द्रप्रस्थ]] (now Delhi)
5. [[Kāshi - काशी\|Kāshi - काशी]] (now Varanasi)
6. [[Anandpur - आनंदपुर\|Anandpur - आनंदपुर]] (now Vadnagar)
7. Among others...

We shall discuss each city in its individual note, with absolute detail... As much as we can find.
In Vadnagar's case, we have the help of a Discovery+ Documentary - "Ananth Anaadi Vadnagar"
For other cities, their sources would be mentioned in their respective notes. 

For most of the cities, the earliest archaelogical evidence is available is generally along the lines of the Pre-Rampart Period of 2nd Century BCE since these are living cities and any houses, shops and other infrsturucture cannot be displaced to dig deeper with heavier machinery.
