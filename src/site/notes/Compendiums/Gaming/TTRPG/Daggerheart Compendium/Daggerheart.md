# Daggerheart
> A Table-Top Role-Playing Game made by Darrington Press & backed by Critical Role. It is releasing on 20th May 2025 but it has been already out in Open Beta since 2024.

This note acts as a player glossary/compendium for the rules and I have attempted to include everything in the folder for the notes here.
This note covers [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/Daggerheart#Rules Summary\|Rules Summary]] and [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/Daggerheart#GM Tips\|GM Tips]].

### Rules Summary
In Daggerheart, a pair of d12 dice are used - known as the [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Duality Dice\|Duality Dice]].
The Character Creation Process is described in [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/DH Character Creation\|DH Character Creation]].
If you want to Multi-class, check the [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/DH Multiclassing Rules\|DH Multiclassing Rules]]
The Combat is decribed in [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/DH Combat Rules\|DH Combat Rules]].
There are specific rules for Character Death (see [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Death Moves\|Death Moves]]).
There are also no shortage of mechanics for [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/DH Character Rest Rules\|DH Character Rest Rules]].

The "[[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/General/Spotlight & GM Move\|Spotlight & GM Move]]" are special Daggerheart Mechanics that I have not seen anywhere else. It is named so since it is a way to showcase the same kind of shift in the spotlight as it is in theatre.

Checking if a player's attack hits an adversary or not is checked via the [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Duality Dice\|Duality Dice]] instead of the classic d20, there are other concepts like [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/General/Hit Point Slots\|Hit Point Slots]] which are fixed for each character (unless increased by taking a specific Class or Foundation) while the characters can spend or mark off [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Armour Slots\|Armour Slots]] (only 1 per attack unless a specific feature allows more than 1) to avoid taking as much damage to their Hit Points and possibly dying. 

Advantage and Disadvantage is marked using a d6 dice rolled along with the 2d12, the result of the d6 dice is added to [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Duality Dice\|Duality Dice]] for advantage and subtracted from the same for disadvantage.

1x [[Hope Token\|Hope Token]] can be spent by any character to give another character apart from themselves an advantage on their rolls. 
Whereas any pair of characters can choose to strike off 3x [[Hope Token\|Hope Token]] each to team up & attack together at the same time.

### GM Tips
Since the system is new, all GMs will be new but some tips:
1. Make your [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/General/Fear Token\|Fear Token]] pool visible to your players on the table in some way shape or form regardless of if you are playing physically or online.
2. ***Avoid undermining Player Success:*** if a PC makes a Finesse roll in an attempt to move stealthily through a hallway, and they succeed with fear, donâ€™t use your move to sound an alarm bell or make someone bump into them, spoiling their cover. Instead, consider options such as introducing a new obstacle at their target destination or adding a new enemy approaching from behind to complicate their situation.
