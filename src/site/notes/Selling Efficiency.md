# Selling Efficiency
> A measure in Sales to check if an employee is worth their salary by tallying the units they have sold compared to their salary. The result is often converted to a decimal point or percentage score.

Formulae used to measure this Efficiency may be different across companies depending upon how contextually relevant or forgiving they wish to be (by comparing it with the average of other employees). 

The most objective formula to find Selling Efficiency (SE) for a singular employee is as follows:
$$\Large \text{SE} = \dfrac{\text{Unit Price}\times\text{Number of units sold}}{\text{Employee Salary}}$$
It is important to note that Number of Units Sold should be on a monthly basis and compared to the monthly salary of the employee. One may do this with an yearly timeframe (both values taken over the course of an year instead) but if trends are to be noted closely, one should stick to monthly SE calculations.

### Average of All Employees
If a business wishes to perform this exercise over a larger subset of their employee base, they can use the average number of units any employee is able to sell in a particular timeframe and compare it with the average salary of an employee of the company.
