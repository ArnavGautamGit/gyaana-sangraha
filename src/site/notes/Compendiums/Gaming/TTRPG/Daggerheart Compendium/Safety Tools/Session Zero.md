# Session Zero
> A session held before Session 1 for any [[Table-Top Role-Playing Game\|Table-Top Role-Playing Game]] that the players are interested in playing. It is held to share and manage expectations, possible things players want from the game among other things.

The Session Zero is held by the GM but it is advised that the players must speak freely and speak their heart out of what they do and what they do not want from a campaign.

> [!important] Session Zero is the MOST IMPORTANT Safety Tool
> It is a basic necessity for any campaigns lasting longer than 1 session since many other safty tools such as [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/Safety Tools/Lines and Veils\|Lines and Veils]] are dependent upon their being a Session Zero.

### Session Goals
The Primary Goal for a session zero is to bring all the players on the same page regarding what the campaign is about, its genre, the system it will use among other things (such as themes that players may want to avoid).

One of the most important things Session Zeroes are used for by far is... scheduling!
Scheduling is the biggest killer of Campaigns and it is important you get that part of the session right.

### Checklist
Dear [[Game Master (GM)\|Game Masters]], there are a few things you must ask your players and these questions for a successful Session Zero must be updated according to feedback from players, your own personal anecdotal experiences and session notes (for example, if you do not run a particular style of game at all, you may change a few questions).

These questions are also divided into categories to make it neater and make questions easier to keep track of & find specific ones. Potentially it also helps in editing by section.

We will first start with a few team-building questions which help the group to think as one and help them see each other's perspective as they voice their thoughts. These questions are made to make them more comfortable:

- [ ] What's the one thing that you love about RPGs or the one thing that made you try out RPGs with this campaign if it is your first time playing?
- [ ] Are you excited to play? If yes then why? Interaction? Strategy? What part of the game appeals to you?
- [ ] Are you most excited by puzzles, roleplay, combat or exploration? If you may, please rank them in order of most to least.
- [ ] As a player, what is the one strength do you think you bring to the group? You may ask other people you know to name something if you are unable to guess it yourself. Other players on the table are also welcome to be consulted for an answer as long as they consent to it.

Now onto the thing that kills most campaigns super easily i.e., scheduling.
It is great and gravely important to iron out the logistics before the sessions begin. 

- [ ] How long can the group reasonably commit to this campaign? How many months or years are the group willing to give this campaign before they move on?
- [ ] How frequently should the sessions be held? Weekly? Bi-Weekly? Once-a-month?
- [ ] How long should a particular session be? Do you want a movie like 2-3 hours or more? Please also try and specify a ballpark region of session length which you are most comfortable in.
- [ ] What is the venue or VTT of choice? Do you have experience with Owlbear Rodeo? Would you require help to learn how the VTT works?
- [ ] What is the preferred day of week and session start timing in your timezone - please also specify your timezone and country.
- [ ] How long are you willing to wait for the last person to show up before the session starts? The longer you wait the shorter the session will get since the ending time is more or less fixed (unless players demand otherwise).
- [ ] What would you do with the character of absentee? How should absenteeism be treated? What would you like the GM to do with your character in case you are absent? 
	- [ ] Should we leave them be as a background character off screen who is tagging along but not involved in interaction?
	- [ ] Should we have them tell the group that they will join in later? And later peg their absenteeism to an in-world reason as to WHY their character was not there? (the character's reasoning will have the player's say)
- [ ] How many times should a player be absent before being removed from the game? It hurts the game's economics since the same game is being run (and the same effort is being put in) for lesser price.

Now, we move onto the next section regarding Table Expectations of genre, style and seriousness of play. If player expectations are not met they might either make excuses to skip the game or maybe they would sit un-interested.

- [ ] Is the general tone of the game dramatic/cinematic or is it comedic?
- [ ] How much narrative control would the players wish to have? Do they want to flesh out entire cities and settlements or would they like the GM to retain most of the control? The players may share any ideas they may have...
- [ ] Is PvP okay and accepted in the group?
- [ ] What are some of the TTRPG Pet Peeves?
- [ ] What are themes you absolutely wish to NOT even be mentioned? If you wish to share this information privately that is completely up to the players. These are the boundaries set by the players 
- [ ] When can a situation be retconned or taken back?
- [ ] According to fellow players what should be the consequences of any player going against the guidelines and crossing the boundaries set by fellow players?

Finally, about Safety Tools:
- [ ] How would you like to signal your X, N and O cards (if we plan on using them)? With hand gestures? Physical Card? Decision to be made with consensus.
