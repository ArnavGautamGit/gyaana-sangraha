Any [[State (United Nations)\|Member State]] can enforce its Customs, Fiscal, Immigration, Sanitary Laws and other Regulations in a limited capacity.

If a particular [[State (United Nations)\|Member State]] decides that they shall claim a lower than maximum of [[Territorial Sea\|Territorial Sea]], they have the option to take a larger CMZ or their CMZ can be narrower if it overlaps with another state's CMZ.

For the CMZ, there are no set rules in cases of overlapping claims and the countries are forced to handle things Bilaterally or in the [[International Court of Justice (ICJ)\|International Court of Justice (ICJ)]].
