# Goblin (DH)
> A [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Ancestries/DH Species Ancestry\|DH Species Ancestry]] of small humanoids with big eyes and bestowed with great hearing despite their small stature. Most Goblins have ears so big that each ear is as big as their head (if not marginally bigger). They can fold their ears to cover their face completely. Average heights range from 3 to 4 feet.

Goblins often use ear positions to communicate non-verbally similar to how "Body Language" works. Due to their large eyes and ears, they tend to be able to see & hear from long distances away.

> [!example] Goblins are their habitats of trust issues
> Goblins live with the Orcs in the Great Orc Desert but some also live in the southern regions of [[Scar Lake Forest\|Scar Lake Forest]]. They also constitute a minority in other regions such as [[Mermaid's Forest\|Mermaid's Forest]] although their image in the public is skeptical and they are not trusted - often even not trusted by the people of their own species
