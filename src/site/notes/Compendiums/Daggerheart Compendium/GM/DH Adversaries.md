# DH Adversaries
> Adversaries in [[Compendiums/Daggerheart Compendium/Daggerheart\|Daggerheart]] are specific villains who the players must act against by choice or otherwise.

Notice how I define it as "acting" against the adversary, the act generally involves fighting but is not limited to the same. This note also mentions the two impportant topics of [[Compendiums/Daggerheart Compendium/GM/DH Adversaries#Adversary Types\|Adversary Types]] and [[Compendiums/Daggerheart Compendium/GM/DH Adversaries#Adversary Feature\|Adversary Feature]].

See [[Vault Templates/DH Adversary Template\|DH Adversary Template]] for templates to create adversaries.
See [[Compendiums/Daggerheart Compendium/GM/Adversary Rolls\|Adversary Rolls]] to see how to roll for Adversaries as a [[Game Master (GM)\|GM]].
See [[Compendiums/Daggerheart Compendium/GM/DH Encounter Design\|DH Encounter Design]] to learn how to use the correct type & number of adversaries.

An Adversary always has: 
1. Name (either specific like "Jacob" or generic like "Goblin 1")
2. Tier (which matches the [[Compendiums/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/DH Character Creation#Character Levelling\|tier of the PCs]] they face).
3. [[Compendiums/Daggerheart Compendium/GM/DH Adversaries#Adversary Types\|Type]]
4. Description
5. Motives & Tactics (provide a basic idea to the GM on how to play them)
6. [[Compendiums/Daggerheart Compendium/General/Difficulty Score\|Difficulty Score]]
7. Damage Thresholds
8. [[Compendiums/Daggerheart Compendium/General/Hit Point Slots\|Hit Point Slots]] (written as HP)
9. [[Compendiums/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Stress Point\|Stress Point]] Slots
10. Attack Modifier
11. Standard Attack - its weapon/name, range and damage on hit
12. Experiences (similar to PCs) activated by [[Compendiums/Daggerheart Compendium/General/Fear Token\|Fear Token]] instead of Hope
13. Features (along with whether they are passive, active or reactions)

### Adversary Types
An adversaryâ€™s type represents the role they play in a conflict. When building encounters, utilizing a mix of types helps create a dynamic and engaging challenge. The adversary types are as follows:
1. ***Bruisers*** are tough and deliver powerful attacks.
2. ***Hordes*** are groups of identical creatures acting together as a single unit.
3. ***Leaders*** command and summon other adversaries.
4. ***Minions*** are easily dispatched but dangerous in numbers.
5. ***Ranged*** are fragile in close encounters but can attack from a distance for high damage.
6. ***Skulks*** maneuver and exploit opportunities to ambush opponents.
7. ***Socials*** present unique challenges to overcome through conversation rather than combat.
8. ***Solos*** present a formidable challenge to a whole party, with or without support.
9. ***Standards*** are rank-and-file adversaries representative of their fictional group.
10. ***Supports*** enhance their allies and disrupt their opponents.

### Adversary Feature
Features are special abilities of the adversaries similar to how PCs get some features from their community, ancestry and class. They can be divided into 3 types:
- ***==Passive Features==*** are always working in the background. Like "Climber" is a passive which allows the adversary to climb as easily as their normal movement.
- ***==Action Features==*** need to be activated by the GM using [[Compendiums/Daggerheart Compendium/General/Fear Token\|Fear Token]] or marking a [[Compendiums/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Stress Point\|Stress]] depending upon the feature.
- ***==Reaction Features==*** are automatically triggerred when a specific event occurs, such as an PC's attack beats their [[Compendiums/Daggerheart Compendium/General/Difficulty Score\|Difficulty Score]] or their attack makes the PC mark an [[Compendiums/Daggerheart Compendium/General/Hit Point Slots\|HP]].
