# System Hacking
> Process of compromising and performing a [[Malicious Hacking\|Malicious Hacking]] operation on the targets of the attack for either sensitive information or extortion of money. 

In case of an ongoing operation, this is generally a part of the "[[Gaining Access\|Gaining Access]]" [[Phases of Hacking\|phase]]. 
Many times, [[Computer Malware\|Computer Malware]] is used to perform the attack. Many of the times new or pre-existing Malware is used to gain sensitive information or extort money.

1. [[Gaining Access\|Gaining Access]] - Bypass Access Controls to gain entry into the system.
2. [[Escalation of Privileges\|Escalation of Privileges]] - to access rights given to another user or superuser. Performed by exploiting known System [[Cyber Security Terminology#Vulnerabilities\|Vulnerabilities]].
3. Executing [[Computer Malware\|Computer Malware]] like [[Trojan Horse (Malware)\|Trojans]], [[Spyware\|Spyware]] or placing backdoors.
4. Hiding certain files using [[Steganography\|Steganography]] or [[Rootkit (Malware)\|Rootkits]].
5. [[Covering Tracks\|Covering Tracks]] by removal of logs and hiding evidence.
