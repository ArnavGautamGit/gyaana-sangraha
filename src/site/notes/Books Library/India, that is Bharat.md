# What is *"India, that is Bharat"* about?
The Book explores the very concpet of India and being Indian. Sai Deepak navigates the book in his classic adocate style which may be a bit hard for non-lawyers to understand.

The book first explores how the European Christians attacked and uprooted other Civilisations aroud the world - starting with the Native Americans, Mayans, Aztecs in the Americas to the Vikings/Asatru in the Nordic Countries in Scandanavia. Moreover, the book explains how a lot of our ideas and vocabulary are based on the residue of the European Culture still left in us.

The second section of the book covers & dismantles the theories propagated in the times of the British - the largest one being that India was never a united country. It uses British Carographer data and Indian History to prove it otherwise. Sai also emphasises that we mustn't judge India with the Eurpean Yardstick of a nation being reserved for one kind of people only where they speak a homogenous language & have a homogenous culture. If that is the case then in my opinion Belgium and China should not be countries due to the lack of homogeniety of language and people. If you excuse China from this saying it was united many times by various dynasties then the entirety of India has also been united under the Mauryan and Nanda rule.
