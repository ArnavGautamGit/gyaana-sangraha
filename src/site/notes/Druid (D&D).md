# Druid (D&D)
> Forest Dwelling beings that harness the power of nature without harming it. This does not mean that they are intensely peace loving, but rather that they want nature to take its course and not disturb it, rather live in it as a part of it.
> 
> Harnessing the magic of animals, plants, and the four elements, Druids heal, transform into animals, and wield elemental destruction. Revering nature above all, individual Druids gain their magic from nature, a nature deity, or both, and they typically unite with other Druids to per form rites that mark the passage of the seasons and other natural cycles.
> 
> Druids often guard sacred sites or watch over regions of unspoiled nature, but when a significant danger arises, Druids take a more active role as ad venturers who combat the threat
