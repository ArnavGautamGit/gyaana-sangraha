# Ethnic Fast Fashion

The plan is: 
1. Kohen is doing Fashion Designing.
2. Sarthak's dad runs a textile mill.
3. I wanna design better Ethnic Clothing, that is more bearable and more fashionable... something similar to Jockey's MOVE collection of Athleisure.

We become Co-owners, Take Kohi into the Legal team as a Legal Head and stuff is sorted! We just need a C.A.... Sarthak can help again. Or we can get some other person on board.
