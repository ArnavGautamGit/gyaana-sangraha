# What is *"Ikigai"* about?
The Book is about finding your own [[Books Library/Related Notes/Ikigai (Japanese Concept)\|Ikigai]] and enhance your longetivity due to actually doing something you love and reducing stress.
The book also emphasises how most of the journey at its core comprises of making small lifestyle changes that eventually compound to enable you to live longer.

### Some Criticism
My Criticism for the book is that it focuses a bit too much on the part of longevity and how to live longer - instead of the reason I picked up the book i.e., finding the [[Books Library/Related Notes/Ikigai (Japanese Concept)\|Ikigai]]. Although the book does introduce the concept and gives you a Venn Diagram, the entire conversation is focused more around how to use your Ikigai and certain lifestyle changes to live longer instead of how to find your Ikigai in the first place.

Another piece of Criticism is that the book seems to repeat similar concepts in different ways and perspectives - it is very well written and flows mesmerisingly but the substance seems to be limited yet dragged. To put it rather bluntly, it sometimes reads like sophisticated rambling riddled with some clever repetition and unnecessary details into the lives of Okinawans as if it is the only healthy lifestyle. 

 I think it is because the book is called "Ikigai" but focuses more on the subtitle surrounding Longevity than on the main title it promises to educate the reader about. There seem to be no techniques to help streamline the process of self-discovery and identifying each part of the given Venn Diagram to first understand Ikigai. A more reflective title probably is: "Live Long with the Japanese Concept of Ikigai". A similar problem to when I read [[Books Library/The Art of Thinking Clearly\|The Art of Thinking Clearly]] earlier in the year & left halfway due to this problem. Coincidentally, both books refer to [[Nassim Nicholas Taleb\|Nassim Nicholas Taleb]] quite a bit who is perhaps the one-eyed man who is leading the blindly obssessed authors.
