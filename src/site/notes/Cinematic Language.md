# Cinematic Language
> A combination of Camera Shots, Angles, motifs, symbols, Background Music and Colour Grading to convey a certain genre, message, emotion or all three using even minimal to no dialogue.

Literature allows you to imagine, Cinema shows it to you directly. Some people may like their own vision or interpretation of how a scene looks better than the director's version... sometimes it may be the other way around.

Cinematic Language is the film analogous to words in Literature: Camera Angles, Camera Flow/Movement, Dialogues, Types of camera shots etc.

Where in literature the author has to use extra words to describe the scene in writing, Cinema allows you to visually see the scene at a glance. It also allows the makers to hide certain information by moving the scene too fast so that the viewer gets less time to register details or use motion blur to blur certain details to reveal at a later point in the story.

# Types of Camera Shots
- There are various types of shots that we would need to earn so that we can analyse the texts and their adaptations well
- #### Type 1: Establishing Shot
	- A shot that establishes the setting, time period etc.
	- Generally the first shot in the change of setting.
- #### Type 2: Long Shot
	- Also called as a "Full Shot"
	- Character shown in full length (or at least shin/ankle length)
	- Subject in full with surroundings
	- Shows the setting and time period as well.
	- #### Type 2(A): Extreme Long Shot
		- Extreme Long Shots show the character trodding on their journey from far away... showing the entire landscape and scale of the things around them with relation to the character.
		- Generally used for the Establishing shot.
- #### Type 3: Medium Shot
	- Shows character at waist height.
	- Shows character but focuses on the action they are performing.
- #### Type 4: Medium Close-up Shot
	- Shows the character chest & up
	- Focus increases on expressions.
- #### Type 5: Close-up Shot
	- Shows the subject almost face only.
	- Little to no background is visible.
- #### Type 6: Extreme Close-up
	- Focuses on one facial feature or object of the character.
	- Used to showcase eye expressions of the character or to showcase the time on a watch that the character is carrying.
	- Used to showcase the eyes, or lips, or nose etc.
- #### Type 7: Two-shot
	- A Medium or Medium Close-up featuring two characters in the same frame, both facing the camera
	- Used for lighter-toned or friendlier character conversation.
- #### Type 8: Over-the-shoulder Shot
	- A medium close-up shot taken from one character's shoulder as they have their backs to the camera, talking to another character (eye-to-eye) who is facing the camera
	- Used for situations when the characters are attending doors or something similar.
### Can certain scenes be depicted using multiple shots?
Note that in Art such as Cinema, it all depends on the director's vision, the emotion to be visually conveyed, the individual story, its setting and the time period. For example, Time is showcased in Game of Thrones series using the Extreme Longshots to show sunrise, sunset, noon, etc.
In modern movies, we can show the watchfaces of the character's wristwatch/pocketwatch depending on the time period.

# Types of Camera Angles
- Angles, combined with shots can give an absolutely amazing cinema experience.
- #### Type 1: High Angle
	- Seldom also called "God's eye view" or "Bird's Angle View" if the angle is extreme

	- Makes subject look vulnerable or helpless
- #### Type 2:  Eye-Level Angle
	- Camera is placed at Eye-level to the subject
	- Used to show neutral feeling or conversation between equals.
- #### Type 3: Low Angle
	- Used to make the subject look powerful, taller.
	- It's extreme form is called the Worm's Eye View
	- #### Type 3(A): Worm's Eye View
		- Camera placed near at the ground level and shot is taken 90 degrees upwards.
		- Used to showcase the environment or Point of view of a character who was sleeping and woke up.
- #### Type 4: Point of View (POV) Angle
	- Could be called as "Perspective Angle" as well.

# Motifs & Symbols often used in Film
- Larger of the multiple characters (like the leader of the group) is given a dominant/central position. Many times, they are taller, or on a pedastal, or closer to the camera.
- ***Image of duality of character*** is shown by being in front of a mirror or mirror character. Generally displayed as an over the shoulder, medium shot so that their reflection is visible in the mirror and both the character and their reflection are seen at the same time. Sometimes shadows are also used for the same.
- If a ***character is in a trapped situation or they are trapped in thought***, they are shown in confined spaces - like sitting in a doorframe, standing infront of a window frame looking outside
- ***Colours***: Green & Black are shown in the matrix reminiscent of old coding softwares. Pycharm still uses Green and Black colourscheme in their logo and UI although font can change colour.
- ***Tilted or canted shadows in Inception*** since dreams do not have perfect graphics and it also symbolises something is off.
- ***Moon***: Suggests night, its size and/or phase impacts its meaning
- ***Roads/Trains***: Shows both inward and outward journey. Crossroads symbolise choice.
