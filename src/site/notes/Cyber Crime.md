# Cyber Crime
> In the law, it is defined as a crime committed via Cyber/Internet/Electronic means.

In the course [[Digital Forensics and Cyber Laws\|Digital Forensics and Cyber Laws]], we are taught about [[Digital Forensics\|Digital Forensics]], Cyber Crime and the Laws regarding these topics. We only cover the [[Cyber Crime#History of Cyber Crimes\|History]] and the [[Cyber Crime#Classification of Cyber Crimes\|Classification]] of Cyber Crimes. 
We already know that the [[Motives of Hackers\|motivation]] is the same as other kinds of lesser Cyber Criminals like [[Black-Hat Hackers\|Black-Hat Hackers]]. Although Cyber Crime is the umbrella term used for all kinds of crime that happens over the internet, here we will mark a distinction between Cyber Crime and [[Malicious Hacking\|Cyber Attacks]] with the latter being a targeted crime while attacks aimed at the masses are a part of the umbrella term which is the former.

### History of Cyber Crimes
We were taught how the earliest Cyber Crimes like the [[USA Free Calling Scam\|USA Free Calling Scam]] emerged.
Basic stuff. Refer to slides for details.

### Classification of Cyber Crimes
Cyber Crimes can be classified into 3 types based on the target of the crime.
1. ***Cybercrime against Individuals***: [[Cyber Stalking\|Cyber Stalking]], [[Cyber Grooming\|Cyber Grooming]] etc.
2. ***Cybercrime against Property***: [[Phishing\|Phishing]], [[CSRF Attack#How is CSRF combined with Phishing to steal from Bank Accounts?\|Bank Account]] & Email Hacking etc.
3. ***Cybercrime against Nations***: [[Cyber Terrorism\|Cyber Terrorism]].

### Challenges in punishing Cyber Criminals
Due to Internet being global, it is only natural extension of logic that ***==Cyber Crime is similarly Global in Nature== making it difficult to Track Criminals*** since they can attack any system or network from anywhere in the world at any time of day. 
Due to differing definitions of Cyber Crime throughout the World, it is ***very hard to initiate or maintain International Cooperation since there is no singular Internationally-accepted Legal Definition which could help settle such matters***. The Legal & Cybersecurity System is biased towards preventing [[Outsider Attacks\|Outsider Attacks]] which is why many [[Insider Attacks\|Insider Attacks]] are successful these days. 

### Motivations & Methods behind Cyber Crimes
Motivations are given in:[[Motives of Hackers\|Motives of Hackers]].
Methods are detailed in: [[Methods & Tools in Cyber Crime\|Methods & Tools in Cyber Crime]].

### Prevention against Cyber Crime
