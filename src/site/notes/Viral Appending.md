# Viral Appending
The procedure of a Virus attaching itself to a healthy program is known as ***Viral Appending***.

A Virus can append in two ways: 
1. ***==Prepend==*** - the virus adds a line to the start of the `main();` function of the index file of the program.
2. ***==Postpend==*** - the virus adds a line to the end of the `main();` function.

Some programs have moved their index files in later updates to more obscure files so Viruses have a harder time attaching to them, Viruses (new ones) have started to delete and override such programs it cannot connect to.
