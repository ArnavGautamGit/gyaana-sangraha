# Forecast Illusion
> The Notion that being able to Foretell something or forecast is completely impossible due to there being so many variable factors that we cannot account for.

It was claimed in [[The Art of Thinking Clearly\|The Art of Thinking Clearly]] that a man named "Philip Tetlock" measured over 28,000 predictions from 284 experts and found that the expert predictions were only marginally better than a random forecast generator. I couldn't verify the claims.

Since Forecasters never face repua penalties for getting things wrong, they are incentivised to keep coming up with new forecasts regardless of their accuracies.
