# Earn More, Spend Less
> A phrase used to describe how to be richer and wealthier in life. A common denominator from all Finance-based Self-Help [[Books\|Books]].

The Principle is not to breed materialism, it is simply the following.
Spending Less on the same salary as we work to increase our salary in the near future.

### How to Earn More?
1. Be in a good surrounding in a specific city or country.
	1. Best talent from IITs and NITs goes abroad
	2. Same work pays more in a richer neighbourhood
2. Get excellent skill in ONE domain
	1. People tend to pay more for better skill
	2. People tend to pay more for specialised (niche) work.
	3. Good Employees make Good Employers (Entepreneurs)
3. Marry someone with low-spending dreams
	1. Hopefully your spouse should be working
	2. Spending in Salons and shit should be low
	3. Hopefully they should have a growth mindset
	4. Hopefully their priorities are in order
4. Be a constant learner
	1. Spend in Learning & Self-Development
	2. Competition decreases as we go to the top
	3. Social Skills =/= Extrovert

### How to spend less
1. Avoid influence from friends else it:
	1. breeds insecurity
	2. breeds FOMO
2. Focus on the present
	1. Focus on how to grow from the current situation.
	2. Do not focus on the train which left station, focus on the next one coming.
3. Prepare for big expenses
	1. ***Vehicles***: Cars can be used for a maximum of 15 years in most of the good parts of the country which means you will need 8-10 cars in a lifetime - a car for yourself, a car for your wife, kids etc.
	2. ***Marriage***: No need to marry by taking loans, Tell your Parents that instead of massive venues and beautiful clothes, invest more in [[Physical Gold Purchases\|Physical Gold Purchases]] and Flats as gifts - We aren't Businessmen who need massive statements like lavish marriages for creating trust in the public.
	3. ***House***: Best is to live with parents, you can easily afford housing, buy and get more houses to give them on rent and create a rental income from them.
4. NEVER TAKE ANY LOAN EXCEPT MEDICAL OR HOUSE LOANS.
5. NEVER USE ANY CREDIT CARDS (if important, set auto-payment).

### Some Major DON'Ts
1. We never invest more than 20% of our potential in one asset.
2. We never invest in an asset where there is a chance of our money becoming zero i.e., [[Checking Asset Fundamentals\|Checking Asset Fundamentals]] is very important.
3. We never invest at the top.
4. We never trust anyone who claims to predict or time the market.
