# Cryptographic Encryption Algorithms
> Specific Mathematical Algorithms made to encrypt and decrypt messages (plaintext). They may be Keyed or Keyless. They are made to be in-line with the [[Objectives of Cyber Security\|Objectives of Cyber Security]] and [[Cyber Security Principles\|Cyber Security Principles]]

Although both [[Keyed Encryption\|Keyed Encryption]] and [[Keyless Encryption\|Keyless Encryption]] exist, but Keyed Algorithms are better in terms of [[Encryption Security\|Encryption Security]] and protection against [[Cryptanalysis\|Cryptanalysis]].

In [[Modern Cryptographic Ciphers\|Modern Cryptographic Ciphers]], on the basis of how many characters/bits an algorithm encrypts or decrypts at a given instance, the algorithms are classified as either [[Stream Ciphers\|Stream Ciphers]] or [[Block Ciphers\|Block Ciphers]]

Any Encryption Algorithm has a seprate Encryption and Decryption Algorithm, but if any algorithm can decrypt and encrypt messages using the same coding function/method, it is called a [[Cipher\|Cipher]].
