# Gold (in Daggerheart)
> Gold tracks how much wealth you have collected on your journey. You can spend it on things such as items, consumables, and equipment. 

Gold is measured in handfuls, bags, and chests, with 10 handfuls equiavlent to 1 bag, and 10 bags to 1 chest. 

When you have marked all of the slots in a category and you gain another gold reward in that category, you mark a slot in the following category and clear all the slots in the current one. For example, if you have 9 handfuls and gain another, you instead mark 1 bag and erase all handfuls. If you have 9 bags and gain another, you mark 1 chest and erase all bags. If you ever have more than 1 chest, you’ll need to store some of your gold before you can take more. 

> [!abstract] OPTIONAL: Gold Coins!
> There is also the option of making things more granular with coins. There exists an optional rule to make coins the lowest denomination where 10 coins is a handful of Gold.
