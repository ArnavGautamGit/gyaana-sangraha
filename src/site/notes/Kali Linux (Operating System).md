# Kali Linux (Operating System)
> A [[Linux\|Linux]] Distribution based on [[Debian Linux\|Debian Linux]] and originally made by a company called "Offensive Security". 

Now the most popular OS for both [[Malicious Hacking\|Malicious Hacking]] and [[Ethical Hacking\|Ethical Hacking]].
It is purposefully made with a lower security level and weaker Firewall to aid in easy access to otherwise non-accessible tasks - which is why it is always run as a [[Virtual Machine\|Virtual Machine]] so that no one can leverage that against the hacker itself.

### CyberSec Standard
Kali Linux allows the users more transparency and control with background processes and has a community which keeps developing tools for the OS.
It also ships built in with [[Wireshark\|Wireshark]], [[BurpSuite\|BurpSuite]], [[Nmap\|Nmap]], [[hping\|hping]], [[Aircrack\|Aircrack]], [[Metasploit\|Metasploit]] etc.

### Commands
Commands are the same as [[Debian Linux#Commands\|Debian Linux > Commands]] due to it being Debian-based.
Please check that link to see all the basic commands for Kali Linux.
