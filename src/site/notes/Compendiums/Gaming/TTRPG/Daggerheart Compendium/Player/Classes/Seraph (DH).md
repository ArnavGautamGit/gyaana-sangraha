# Seraph (DH)
> A [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/DH Character Creation#Character Class\|Character Class]] of Divine, Winged Warriors and Healers given a special purpose by their God. They do morally good things such as protecting the weak and helping the innocent. 

It is said to be better to be an ally of the Seraphs instead of a foe.
Optimise your character by prioritising [[Strength\|Strength]].

### Domains
Domains of a class decide the Domain Cards (and abilities) one gets to pick up.
Each class has 2 fixed Domains.
The Seraph's domains are: [[Splendor\|Splendor]] and [[Valor\|Valor]].

### Base Scores
Base [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Evasion Score\|Evasion Score]]: 9
Base [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/General/Hit Point Slots\|Hit Point Slots]]: 7

### Class Items
Each Class has a specific item they choose which will be a plot point in the story. They must choose one of the options.
For a Seraph, choose EITHER *"Bundle of Offerings"* OR *"Sigil of your God"*.

### Seraph's Hope
***Life Support:*** Spend 3x [[Hope Token\|Hope Token]] to clear 1x [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/General/Hit Point Slots\|Hit Point Slots]] on an ally in Close Range.

### Class Feature - Prayer Dice
***Prayer Dice*** allows the player to roll a number of d4 dice equal to your Spellcast trait at the beginning of each session and store them. The player is allowed to spend one or more of these dice at any time to aid yourself or an ally within Far range. You can use the spent dice’s value to reduce any incoming damage or add to any roll result after the roll. Alternatively, you can exchange the value for that many Hope you can give to any other PC in range. Clear any unused dice at the end of each session.

### Class Foundations (Subclasses)
Spellcasting Trait is [[Strength\|Strength]] for both the subclasses

- ***==Winged Sentinel==*** allows you to play a RPG analogous to a Winged Air Bomber.
	- ***Foundation Feature*** 
		- ***Wings of Flight:*** You gain the ability of flight. The play may choose to:
			- Spend 1x [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Stress Point\|Stress Point]] to pickup and carry a willing creature which is approximately the size of the Seraph or Smaller.
			- Mark 1x [[Hope Token\|Hope Token]] to add 1d8 additional damage to any enemy on successful attack roll.
	- ***Specialisation Feature***
		- ***Ethereal Visage:*** Your supernatural visage strikes awe and fear. While in flight, you have advantage on Presence Rolls, and if that roll is a success with Hope, you can remove a Fear from the GM's Fear Pool instead of gaining Hope.
	- ***Mastery Feature***
		- ***Ascendant:*** Permanently Increase your Severe Damage Threshold by +4.
		- ***Power of Gods:*** deals 1d12 additional damage instead of 1d8.
- ***==Divine Wielder==*** allows you to play a ground-based fighter with Minor Healing.
	- ***Foundation Features***
		- ***Spirit Weapon***: Any Melee/Very Close Weapon can be thrown and it returns back to the Seraph's Handsas long as the enemy is in Close Range. Mark 1x [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Stress Point\|Stress Point]] to add another target without rolling again.
		- ***Sparing Touch***: Once per long rest, clear 2x [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/General/Hit Point Slots\|Hit Point Slots]] OR 2x [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Stress Point\|Stress Point]] by touching them.
	- ***Specialisation Feature***
		- ***Devout***: Seraph has the option to roll an extra Prayer Dice and discard the score of the lowest one.
		- ***Sparing Touch Upgrade***: Sparing Touch can be used now twice per long rest.
	- ***Mastery Feature***
		- ***Sacred Resonance:*** When you roll damage for your “Spirit Weapon” feature, if any of the die results match, double the value of each matching die. For example, if you roll two 5s, they count as two 10s.

### Background Questions
It is optional to answer any of the following background questions to refine or get ideas for your character's backstory. You can also create your own questions. 
- Which god did you devote yourself to? What incredible feat did they perform for you in a moment of desperation?
- How did your appearance change after taking your oath?
- In what strange or unique way do you communicate with your god?

### Connections

- Why do you ask me so many questions about my god?
- You’ve told me to protect one member of our party above all others, even yourself. Who are they and why?
