# What are the various forms of Adaptation?
***==Adaptation==*** is the act of changing something to make it suitable for new purpose or situation.
***==Literary Adaptation==*** is (by extension) the act of changing the literary piece written by the same author or someone else to make it suitable for a new audience of (possibly) a new time period or set of beliefs. 

Adaptations come in many shapes & sizes:
1. Hollywoodised/Bollywoodised
2. Politicised
3. Accultured
4. Loose Adaptation
5. Faithful Adaptation
6. Literal Adaptation

Note that there can be more such adaptation categories that are possible but they are beyong our course.
Also, An adaptation could be a part of two categories. For example, the Indian Adaptation of "Pride & Prejudice" is Accultured, Bollywoodised and a Faithful Adaptation all at the same time.
