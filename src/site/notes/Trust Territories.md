Palau was originally a German colony in [[The First World War (WW1)\|The First World War (WW1)]] but handed to the [[Empire of Japan\|Empire of Japan]] in 1920 as a part of South Pacific [[Mandates\|Mandates]]. 

In 1945, [[United Nations (U.N)\|The UN]] created the [[U.N Trusteeship Council\|U.N Trusteeship Council]] & placed Palau as a Trust Territory instead of restoring the Japanese Mandate after USA in the [[The Second World War (WW2)\|The Second World War (WW2)]]captured all Pacific Territories of [[Empire of Japan\|Empire of Japan]] and one clear coloniser could not be blamed.
