# International Court of Justice (ICJ)
> A Judicial Organ of the [[United Nations (U.N)\|United Nations (U.N)]] responsible for upholding & passing judgements on legal disputes between [[State (United Nations)\|UN Member States]] using the [[International Law\|International Law]]. 
> Any [[State (United Nations)\|UN Member State]] can sue another member state in the ICJ if the appealing state feels that the accused state has violated any one or more UN Conventions after having signed them.

Needless to say, only [[State (United Nations)\|UN Member States]] can propose a case or appeal for it in the ICJ & *no private individuals or organisations are entertained by the Judicial Body*. This is the biggest point of difference between the ICJ and the [[International Criminal Court (ICC)\|International Criminal Court (ICC)]] which can be approached by Human Rights Organisations.

Naturally, States *cannot be sued* for violation of a Convention ***which they did not sign***. Only signatories to a convention can be sued for violation of the same.

### Purpose
Protect the [[International Law\|International Law]] and Prevent any violations of the same.
Prevents any one state from being free from consequences of violations.
Solves Legal Disputes between [[State (United Nations)\|UN Member States]].

### Weaknesses
Firstly, their Rulings are technically legally binding on the states but ***the ICJ holds no enforcement power of its own*** & ***their rulings NOT automatically enforced by the [[United Nations Security Council (U.N.S.C)\|UNSC]] either***. It is also seen that seldom the Permanent UNSC Members even Veto the ruling itself.

Secondly, ***both the sides MUST consent to ICJ having Jurisdiction in the issue***. It is natural that the appealing state appeals since it consents to the same but ***the accused [[State (United Nations)\|Member State]] must also consent to the ICJ having jurisdiction in the matter which attracted the accusation*** since if the accused state denies the ICJ any jurisdiction in the dispute, then the case cannot go forward & any independent, third-party investigation cannot take place.
