# Requirement Ellicitation
> The techniques of find out & writing down the user and systems requirements and other requirments in Technical Language to interpret what features the client requires in the software since Natural Language often mixes functional & non-functional requirements i.e., it is a bunch of jargon which lacks clarity and precision.

Techniques for Requirement Ellicitation are given below:

- #### Technique 1: Interview
	- Structured Inteview: Questions to ask and Information to be gathered is already decided.
	- Open Interviews: Un-structured Interviews.
	- Oral Interview
	- Written Interview
	- one-to-one interview
	- Group interview
- #### Technique 2: Surveys + Questionaire
	- Set of questions with objective
	- if options are not encompassing all possible answers then results may be wrong since the surveyee wouldn't be able to enter their true answer.
	- Due to the flaw mentioned above, the survey/questionaire technique is considered ==unreliable== and ==not taken seriously== unless supplemented with another one of the techniques.
- #### Technique 3: Task Analysis
	- Team of engineers analyse the operation for which the new system is required.
	- IF the client already has some software which was previously being used to perform certain operation (preferably similar/the same operation) it is studied and requirements of proposed system is collected
- #### Technique 4: Brainstorming
	- An informal debate among stakeholders is held and their inputs are recorded.
- #### Technique 5: Prototyping
	- UI without details for user to interpret the features of intended software product.
	- Gives better idea of requirements.
	- If there is no software installed at the client's end for reference, the developer creates a prototype.
- #### Technique 6: Observation:
	- Team of experts make a visit to the client's workplace to understand the actual working of the organisation. To see what environment and people will run the software andf at what load.
