# Fear Token
> Fear is a resource that is tracked by the [[Game Master (GM)\|Game Master (GM)]] in the form of tokens and use said tokens to introduce challenges to the players' path, make the scene dramatic by raising the stakes etc.

There can be only a maximum of 12 Fear Tokens that the GM can have at a particular time. GMs gain a Fear when players roll a [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Duality Dice\|Duality Dice]] Roll with Fear (i.e., they roll higher on the Fear Dice in a Duality Role).

When you decide to spend fear, you can:
1. Interrupt the players and steal the [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/General/Spotlight & GM Move\|Spotlight]].
2. Use an Adversary's Fear Feature.
3. Use the Environment's Fear Feature.
4. Add an Adversary's Experience to a Roll.

### Tips
Some additional tips for making it look natural & blend it into the scene for a more polished experience, it is advised to Act First, spend consistently to appear fair and draw blood (use a Fear to make sure your attack still counts if you miss).

An additional advice for a greater cinematic experience, use a lot of fear before a major fight to [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/General/Spotlight & GM Move\|Spotlight]] adversaries at once right as the fight starts, this will put your PCs on the backfoot, making it seem like they are turning the tide of battle near the end when you are low on Fear.

To improvise fear moves, go with something along the lines of introducing a new adversary or the adversary using magic to get away or using magic to deal massive amount of damage!
