# Indus Valley Civilsation
> An Indian Civilisation that existed along the banks of the rivers Indus, Saraswati and all their tributaries during the peak and the decline phases of the [[Chalcolithic Period\|Chalcolithic Period]]. Due to there being a total of 7 rivers, with the western-most river being Indus (Sindhu), this region was also called "Sapta-Sindhu" region in Sanskrit.

The Indus Valley began began around 2200 BC and naturally began to slowly disband and lose population at around 700 BC.
Much of what we know about Indus Valley Civilisation comes from [[Archaeological Evidence\|Archaeological Records]] since we are unable to decipher the heiroglyphic script they used to write their language. In fact, we do not know what language they used - we can only estimate. 

### Formation
As we studied in [[Chalcolithic Period\|Chalcolithic Period]] notes, after 3000 BC people of various places came to realise that there is money in trade & commerce - people began to form markets at set location where everyone would come to sell their goods in forms of trade fairs. Eventually, to save transport costs, permanent settlements for trade began to come up in highly commercial and fertile lands - these lands were blessed with two massive rivers of Indus and Saraswati along with their tributaries. 

### Extent & Prominent Sites
Indus Valley Civilisation extended from Manda in Kashmir being its northermost city, the city of Silkagan Dol being its western-most city in today's Iran, Southernmost frontier being manned by Daimabad in modern Maharashtra while the eastern-most city was Manjupur which falls in modern western Uttar Pradesh, not far from Delhi. 
In total, it was 1,299,600 square Kilometres in Area!

Prominent Sites of Indus Valley Excavations are in Mohenjo-Daro, Harappa, Rakhigarhi, Dholavira and Ganweriwala.

### Identity
Indus Valley Civilisation is NOT referred to as Iranian (🇮🇷) because Silkagan Dol is on the eastern-most tip of Iran's border with present-day Pakistan. Hence there is very little Iranian territory that is a part of IVC. Not to mention, there were other civilisation-centres in Iran which influenced Zoroastrian Iran a lot more than here.

Indus Valley Civilisation is often called as Indian (and not Pakistani) since there is evidence of bigger settlements on the modern-day Indian side such as Rakhigarhi and Dholavira. In fact, there were ***dockyards found in Lothal*** sites of modern-day Gujarat (Indian Gujarat).
Also, the term Pakistan was not even coined until nearly 2600 years AFTER the disbanding of Indus Valley - Pakistan was first referenced in 1937 AD while IVC disbanded in around 700 BC. Everyone until 1947 knew this land as India. Moreover, the excavation of [[Pashupati Seal\|Pashupati Seal]] and Shivalingas cement it as a Hindu Civilisation older than [[Islam\|Islam]].

### Cultural & Architectural Finds
IVC was known heavily for city-planning. We know that all streets intersected at 90 degrees in a grid structure with covered drains with each house having its draining merging with the covered drains on either side of the road. These drasins would merge into the main drains along larger roads.

We have also found evidences of [[Motte & Bailey Castles\|Motte & Bailey Castles]] being built in this civilisation and Dockyards at the sea near Lothal sites in modern-day Gujarat (India).

We have also found statues such as [[Statue of the Bearded Man\|Statue of the Bearded Man]], [[Bronze Dancing Girl Statue\|Bronze Dancing Girl Statue]] along with religious [[Terracotta Mother Goddess Staues\|Terracotta Mother Goddess Staues]] which showcase female goddesses of fertility with flowers blooming out of their navels (indiciating both soil & female fertility).

Along with statues, there is also the excavation of the [[Pashupati Seal\|Pashupati Seal]] and Shivalingas! This is evidence that the Indus Valley Civilisation prayed to Hindu Gods like [[Lord Shiva\|Lord Shiva]] - reinforcing the hindu identity of the IVC. Although, there are NO EVIDENCE found of any discrimation based on caste, gender, creed, religion and so forth.

### Produce & Exports
IVC has been proven to export cotton to [[Ancient Egyptian Civilisation\|Ancient Egyptian Civilisation]] and other contemporaries in Mesopotamian and Sumerian regions which earned it a name of "Meluha" in Central Asia especially in Sumerian Texts while cotton began to be known as "sindon" meaning "from/of Sindhu" which we know is the Sanskrit name of Indus.

Apart from this, presence of textiles is further supported by intervowen, well-defined clothing on [[Statue of the Bearded Man\|Statue of the Bearded Man]].

On the [[Pink Sindhu Pottery\|Pink Sindhu Pottery]] samples found in the IVC region, we see geometric designs decorate the pinkish-pottery and many times traces of Wheat, Barley, Seasummum, Mustard, Rai, Pea and Rice were found on excavated samples - meaning that they were cultivated although rice seems to be imported more than cultivated if Mesopotamian texts are to be trusted.

### Decline
Eventually around 1500-1300 BC it was said that river Saraswati had dried up completely while the decline in her water volume had already begun at around 1800 BC. This hurt the fertility of the soil in the region which meant that people could not sustain farming at the current rate - this started a slow decline in food grain availability. Imports from Sumerian and Mesopotamian civilisations now started to include other grains apart from rice.

Eventually the cities became too hard to maintain as people started to move towards the [[North Indian Plains\|North Indian Plains]] fed by river [[Ganga-Brahmaputra-Barak River System\|Ganga]] and its tributaries such as Yamuna. This ended the first urbanisation since society moved into majorly rural Janapadas during the [[Indian Vedic Period\|Indian Vedic Period]].

# Footnotes
It is recommended to read the works of DP Agrawal & other experts and to gain better understanding - also I am unsure how much of the harappan script has been deciphered but will update links and notes when it is deciphered finally.
