# Personal Coat of Arms
> A practice in [[Heraldry\|Heraldry]] where a person would depict themselves either with a [[Escutcheon\|Escutcheon]] or a [[Heraldic Achievement\|Heraldic Achievement]] for identification of participants in a case of war or any public tournaments.

It is important to note that I did NOT make this to intentionally fake or claim a nobel rank in a democratic republic like India or elsewhere. It is only made for the intention of creating a unique personal brand to be used in informal printables and/or informal digital works as complementary or supplementary to my name & identity. This will never be used in government works and I shall never use it to violate any law or guidelines set by the government of India or wherever I reside. 

### Blazon

> Crest: *"Issuant from a torse Gules and Or, a conch shell Argent resting fesswise with its mouth to sinister"*
> 
> Mantling: *"Gules doubled Or"*

As seen in Historical Records, each Coat of Arms required a blazon which would be used as a descriptor of the design that needed to be painted on the shield of each soldier that does not carry a personal Coat of Arms. Even among those that do, it was common to use the state's Coat of Arms in cases of War if their own arms are not extensively famous.

Blazons were also read out aloud on Jousting Arena for both riders. The designs are dependent on the blazons written & the design may change certain specifics depending upon artstyle and things not specified in the Blazon (since it needs to be short). Example: my shield may have a different version with a different artstyle or shield shape depending upon the artist.

### Design Meaning
The colours Gules (Red) and Or (Gold) reflect passion and reverence respectively for the subjects and topics depicted via charges on the arms.

The Two-handed Sword is placed in chief to depict the armiger's (Arnav's) appreciation of martial prowess as he formerly used to practice martial arts (Karate and Judo) in the earliest part of his life as a child and have always held an interest in [[Historical European Martial Arts (HEMA)\|Historical European Martial Arts (HEMA)]] and [[Swordfighting\|Swordfighting]]. The Sword placed fesswise (horizontally) depicts that the sword is laid peacefully, only to be picked up in defence (i.e., I only use my martial prowess in defence of my loved ones). 

The majuscule (capital) Omega displays his conscientiousness & diligence. I finish any task I start and take it to a logical end. The Omega is also the last alphabet of the greek alphabet which (here) also depicts my interest in learning both Greek and Indian Philosophies. It also hold the philosophical meaning that the end of life (or death) must not be feared from, rather be held as a reminder that we need to make this life as great as possible before it inevitably ends - whenever death arrives.

The Conch Shell ("Śankha" or "Shankha") depicts one's call towards duty like the Divine Shankha blown by Lord Krishna on the battlefield of Kurukshetra in the Hindu Epic of [[Mahābhārata\|Mahābhārata]] (and by extension also the [[Shrimad-Bhagavad Gītā\|Shrimad-Bhagavad Gītā]]). It is a reminder that one must focus on one's Karma (Duty) to their best ability and not on the Phala (Result) one gets after performing it since the diligence of their work lies in their hands even if the result is not in their control so one should only act, without worrying about things out of their control (solution-based approach).

As mentioned previously, artstyles may change on the artist who designed and coloured the arms or the charges within it. Different representations are considered heraldically correct as long as the Blazon is followed.

In the modern day, the artstyle changes on the softwares used as hence have made the final version on June 6th, 2025 using another website named [Heraldicon](https://heraldicon.org).

### Why an Omega & not a Hindu Symbol?
The Omega represents the end of the greek alphabet, meaning it can represent the end of a linear arrangement of letters similar to how death represents the end of a linear life. 

I use the Omega to signify how I am not afraid of death & each task I undertake is taken to a logical end. [[Hinduism\|Hinduism]] believes in a cycle of life & death instead of a linear lifetime. I would not remember anything of this life going into the next - personalities are a product of environment and since the environment might be completely different in my next life, there is no point of having a symbol which represents cyclical life. Moreover, since shields might get damaged and stamps/seals carrying the shield often get torn, I did not consider it to be respectful to put a religious image on my arms knowing it might be damaged or torn but I would rather put religious imagery on my crest to signify that [[Hinduism\|Hinduism]] & my hindu identity is greater than me (which is a body made of [[Māyā\|Māyā]]). 

I also realise that many historical Hindu dynasties disagree with me on this and prominently feature Hindu Symbols but I am a human, not a sheep. I am under no obligation to follow the herd.

This artwork was finished & almost immediately posted on Reddit (particularly the subreddit pertaining to [[Heraldry\|Heraldry]], known as r/heraldry) for timestamping purposes. It garnered praise and upvotes since it fit most rules of Heraldry except the only one mentioned in the design section above. The Link is provided in the footnotes. It is to be notes however that this does not detract from my copyright over the ARTWORK itself as it remains my original. Since it was not meant to be submitted for Heraldry of the World or Formal Copyright, the artwork as shared on Reddit may look lower quality but the copy that is now my Reddit Profile Picture is the highest quality banner made using the same elements (charges & colours) of the Coat of Arms & hence also my copyrighted art.
