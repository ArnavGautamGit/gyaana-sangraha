# Racism Against Indians in South Korea
A common place nowadays when there are Indians who absolutely love everything that is Korean and they go crazy for Korean snacks & other amenities (enough so that its is now even sold by Blinkit)

A lot of racist instances go unnoticed or they are brushed aside since "there are racists everywhere" and "only a few people are racists" etc.

The thing is there are instances of much bigger instances where there was racism that no one in South Korea even protested against rather made the series including those racist mentions very popular! Let's see a few examples.

### ***Example 1***: Redice Studios & Manhwa
Redice Studios - the biggest name in Manhwa business and the creators of the famous Manhwa "Solo Levelling" (which also became a show later) released a new manhwa named "Regressing with the King’s Power". If you are going to read Chapter 27 of that Manhwa, if you are Indian you will find it disturbing to say the least.

The villain of the story is of Indian Origin who is named "Narandra Neru", there is no need to explain that the name is derived from two of India's Longest Serving Prime Ministers i.e., the current PM when this comic was released (Mr. Narendra Modi) and the first-ever PM of Independent India (Jawaharlal Nehru). Where the first name is taken from the current PM, the last name is taken from the first PM of Independent India.

This is not even the most disturbing news, the disturbing news is the fact that this character is not only a villain but runs a Terrorist Organisation which conducts terror attacks that look eerily similar to [[9/11 Terrorist Attack\|9/11 Terrorist Attack]] (which did not even involve Indians by the way).

The important thing to note is that this character is greeting with a Namaste, which is classically a greeting of Indian & Hindu Origin. So the defense that there was a particular confusion regarding Afghans & Indians or Pakistanis & Indians flies right out of the window.

Before the Apologists fly in and say that "Indians are Racist too" we do not equate any particular race of people with Osama Bin Laden just because they lived closer to each other.

This is not the first time Redice Studios have done something similar to/about Indians. It is a regular occurance and they are habitual repeat offenders of this. Redice themselves have done this before, in one of the chapters of their manhwa named "Solo-Max Level Newbie", they had this weird segment involving two Indian Characters named "Chandra" and "Arun" and the main character of the Manhwa comic made them run semi-naked in Seoul, and its news was shown on TV that thos two characters got arrested.

### ***Example 2***: Road Signs of "Indians not allowed" all around Seuol
I don't even care to spell the city's name correctly at this point where Indians are treated with similar sign boards like the 20th Century British Colonial times in another country which has a brutal history of colonisation. This is the equivalent of Apartheid practised in South Africa where certain locations were off-limits for natives just because their skin looked different to the whites.

These signs were exposed in videos by YouTubers like [Nikita Thakur](https://youtu.be/fgHN5ErCAdk?feature=shared), [Nomadic Indian](https://youtu.be/XQoL0_L0ge4?feature=shared) and [Bibim Korea 비빔코리아](https://youtube.com/shorts/9m9sE-9BOk0?feature=shared). Clicking on each link will redirect you to respective videos. Note that there are MANY MANY MORE such videos.

Please don't try to whitewash this as something like "protecting your culture against foreigners" since that does not work... Korea's neighbouring country of Japan does not single out Indians specifically by nationality & race like this.

Japan is much more civil than that. They dis-allow all non-Japanese in certain parts yes, but not specify individual races/nationalities like this to make them feel specifically targeted. They definitely do not showcase Indians as a group of Terrorists committing attacks like [[9/11 Terrorist Attack\|9/11]].
