# D&D Action Rules
> Rules in [[Compendiums/D&D Compendium/Dungeons & Dragons\|D&D]] relating to actions such as what constitutes as an action and how many actions a player can take at once.

Unless you have an ability that allows you to make an Extra Action or Bonus Action then you can only take 1 Action and 1 Bonus Action per turn when in Combat.
Out of Combat, [[D&D Action Economy\|Action Economy]] is nothing to fret about since it does not apply. 

### Actions
In short, anything you do including the following: Attack, Dash, Disengage, Dodge, Help, Hide, Influence an NPC, Use Magic, Ready your weapon, Search a location/object, Study an object, Utilize a non-magical object (not necessarily for an attack).

### Bonus Actions
Only those spells, abilities and features that are specifically mentioned to be a Bonus Action be used as such. Others are to be treated as Actions.
Unless timing is specified, Bonus Actions can be made before or after the Action.

### Reactions
Certain special abilities, spells, and situations allow you to take a special action called a Reaction. A Reaction is an instant response to a trigger of some kind, which can occur on your turn or on someone else's. 

Reactions such as "The Opportunity Attack" and "Shield" are the most common type of Reaction. When you take a Reaction, you can't take another one until the start of your next turn. If the reaction interrupts another creature's turn, that creature can continue its turn right after the Reaction. 

In terms of timing, a Reaction takes place immediately after its trigger unless the Reaction's description says otherwise.
