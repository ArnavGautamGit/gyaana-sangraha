# Infernis (DH)
> A [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Ancestries/DH Species Ancestry\|DH Species Ancestry]] of humanoids with sharp canines, pointed ears and horns coming in various styles. Horns are mostly symmetric and even-numbered but any amount of horns (maximum 5-6) are allowed. The horns may even reconnect to form one singular looped horn. Some Infernis may be born with or without tails which may or may not be forked. It is important to note that the number and nature of the horns and tail(s) is not hereditary.
> Creativity of the player is the limit to all the character creation possibilities presented here.

Infernis are famous for carving, shaping, decorating and even reinforcing their horns just like how [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Ancestries/Galapa (DH)\|Galapa (DH)]] are famous to do the same for their shells. Infernis are also known for having a height between 5 to 7 feet tall. Also, this ancestry was previously called "Daemon".

On taking Inferis, you gain the following Ancestry Features:
- ***Fearless***: Mark 2x [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Stress Point\|Stress Point]] to turn a Roll with Fear into a Roll with Hope.
- ***Dread Visage***: Gain Advantage on Intimidation Rolls.

Dread Visage involves a change in eyecolour, elongation of nails and/or twisting of horns (slightly painful) either for intentional intimidation or due to the character experiencing a nightmare or getting scared themselves. 

Average Lifespans of an Inferis: 350 years

> [!info] INFO: No one like the Inferis in Lurov
> They appeared from the other side of the Wall in [[Forever Dark\|Forever Dark]] and no one knows anything about them - they have created their own settlements far from Vulcanroth in an island between the [[Princely State of Vulcanroth\|Princely State of Vulcanroth]] and the Eastern Maritime Border of the [[Kingdoms/The Elven Confederacy\|The Elven Confederacy]]
