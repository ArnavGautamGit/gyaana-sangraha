# Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (Subject)
> It was also the name of a subject in my 8th Semester (final semester) of my B.Tech Computer Science Engineering Degree at JIIT, Noida. 

The Subject is taught by Janadhan Sir who is notorious as a professor who doesn't give a flying fuck about when you walk into the class. His teaching skill sucks and his handwriting really resembles dead bugs on the Whiteboard.

### Syllabus
- [[Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)\|Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)]] (and the types, components)
- [[Autopilot Design\|Autopilot Design]]
