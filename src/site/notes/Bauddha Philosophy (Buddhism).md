# Bauddha Philosophy (Buddhism)
> Also known as Buddhism, the Baudha Philosophy (or the "Bauddha Darshana" as it is often referenced in Sanskrit) was largely founded by Siddhartha Gautama although there have been multiple buddhas before him who some Buddhists claim to have also been a part of their philosophy and many of these previous buddhas before Siddhartha seem to be common with people appearing in the [[Shāstras\|Shāstras]] of [[Hinduism\|Hinduism]].

I do not claim to know much of Buddhism let alone to be an expert but I acknowledge that the two religions of Buddhism and [[Hinduism\|Hinduism]] often share many similarities. Both Buddhist & Hindu Monks prefer not to eat meat but there are differences in many other practices.

### Basic History of Buddhism organising into a religion
For the longest period of time Kushinagar & Devariya were the same district, now they have split but back in 583 BC, a boy named Siddhartha Gautama was born in present-day Nepal in a royal family as the only son of the King, he was prophesized to become either a great king or a great monk by a Hindu priest who looked as his horoscope. (Hinduism back then was different from modern hinduism)

It is said that Buddha attained [[Nirvana\|Nirvana]] in 49 days under the Bodhgaya tree which is in the present-day city of Gaya in Bihar (India) and that is how the tree was named as an amlgamation of Budhha and Gaya.

After achieveing enlightenment, it is said that Siddhartha took on the name Buddha and wrote the text named "Dhammachakraparvartan" (apologies for any spelling mistakes). To differentiate him from other Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, he is called as "Gautama Buddha" in many places.

In the year 483 BC, Gautama Buddha passed away in Kushinagar which is a location in the outskrits of modern Kushinagar (that has become its own district of Devariya recently). A Buddhist council was called by all the mahakashyapas & patronised by the Ruler of the Magadha Empire, King [[Ajātashatru\|Ajātashatru]]. Here Ananda wrote/compiled the Sutta Pittaka while Upali compiled the Vinaya Pittaka.
This was later numbered as the [[First Buddhist Council (483 BC)\|First Buddhist Council (483 BC)]]

### Later Buddhist Councils & emergence of Buddhist Sects
In 383 BC, precisely 100 years later the [[Second Buddhist Council (383 BC)\|Second Buddhist Council (383 BC)]] was called in the city of Vaishali (present-day Bihar) by Sabakami and patronised by a king named as [[Kālashoka\|Kālashoka]] in the literature. Heavy debates happened on if the rules mentioned in the Vinaya Pittaka must be relaxed. The opinions of the scholars created two informal sects - Sthaviravardins who proposed no changed informally split from Mahasangika sect who proposed a few liberal changes.

In 250 BC, the [[Third Buddhist Council (250 BC)\|Third Buddhist Council (250 BC)]] was called by [[Ashoka\|Ashoka The Great]] of the [[Mauryan Empire\|Mauryan Empire]] where Mogaliputra Tissa gave a [[Upānishads\|Upānishad]]-like philosophical text of Sutta Pittaka & named as "Abhidhamma Pittaka". Ashoka's children themselves started to work as Buddhist missionaries.

The [[Fourth Buddhist Council (72 AD)\|Fourth Buddhist Council (72 AD)]] was called in Kundalagram (present-day Kashmir) under King [[Kanishka\|Kanishka]] of the [[Kushan Empire\|Kushan Empire]]. This is the council where there was a formal split between [[Mahāyāna Buddhism\|Mahāyāna Buddhism]] and [[Hīnayāna Buddhism\|Hīnayāna Buddhism]]. 

A third sect named [[Vajrayāna Buddhism\|Vajrayāna]] popped up in the times of the [[Gupta Empire\|Gupta Empire]] later when tantra became a part of Buddhism. Bodhisattvas & Taras started to be worshipped along the Buddha with their own statues. Hindus of Northern India accepted Buddha as the 9th incarnation of Vishnu while Krishna was called as the 8th Avatar. Balarāma was now referred to as an incarnation of [[Ananta Shesha\|Ananta Shesha]] instea dof being the original 8th avatar of Vishnu. Southern Indian Hindus still follow the old list with Balarāma as 8th & Krishna as 9th avatars.

[[Vajrayāna Buddhism\|Vajrayāna Buddhism]] was later patronised by the [[Pala Dynasty of Bengal\|Pala Dynasty of Bengal]] who created the [[Vikramshila University\|Vikramshila University]] as well. [[Nālanda\|Nālanda]] & Vikramshila popularised Vajrayāna in Tibet.
His Holiness the Dalai Lama still follows [[Tibetan Buddhism\|Tibetan Buddhism]] inspired from the Vajrayāna sect.

### His Holiness the Dalai Lama's opinion on Hinduism 
Many Tibetan Buddhists, like His Holiness, the [[14th Dalai Lama\|14th Dalai Lama]] have publically said the following with reference to Hinduism and Buddhism:
> [!quote] His Holiness gives a Tree & Branch Analogy
> "You ([[Hinduism\|Hinduism]]) are the tree, we (Buddhism) are the branches."
>
> ~ His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama in a conversation which can be dated to be around 1978 told the Indian Prime Minister of the time (Shri [[Morarji Desai\|Morarji Desai]]) when he asked if Buddhism and Hinduism emerged from the same pillar of dharma. 
> This exchange (among other exchanges) were reported by [The Open Magazine](https://openthemagazine.com/columns/no-mercy)

The added context being that [[Tibetan Buddhism\|Tibetan Buddhism]] is influenced by the [[Vajrayāna Buddhism\|Vajrayāna Buddhism]] whose structural studies originated in [[Nālanda\|Nālanda]]. It is important to note that while I do not claim that Buddhism originated from Hinduism (since present-day hinduism has evolved a long way to be very different from hinduism of that era) but it cannot be refuted that there has been a lot of influence from various Indian Philosophies that have Hindu origins.

His Holiness the Dalai Lama frequently accepts that some concepts are similar with the only concept being different being the Buddhist of an-atman (no-self). While atman is often believed to refer to soul in Hinduism (since Soul refers to self) but buddhism has a different interpretation & many
