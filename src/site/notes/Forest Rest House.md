# Forest Rest House
> a House built in the forests for rest i.e., for rotating stay of multiple guests who stay indoors only for food and sleep, it is not to be used like a permanent residence of any kind. It is owned by the [[Forest Rangers (वन विभाग)\|Forest Rangers (वन विभाग)]]. 

They are strategically built in locations which provide the best views on the site either from the rest house itself or within a walking radius. For example, [[FRH Nagthat\|FRH Nagthat]] provides a 270 degree view from the rest house and small [[Trek to the top of the ridge\|trek to the top of the ridge]] will allow you to see the other side as well. 

The reason for being built in locations with the best view is to be able to see and cover large areas of forests in the mountains so they can be preserved by being kept under watch.
