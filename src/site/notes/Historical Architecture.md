# Historical Architecture
> A study of Architecture of Historic Buildings - from homes of average people to Monuments built by their rulers, a change in architecture in either can reflect a change in the Art & Culture of any civilisation and such changes are always due to important historical events.

Note that [[Civil Engineering\|Civil Engineering]] is a separate subject that I do not understand nor do I claim to have any study or expertise in.

### Ancient India
We know that Ancient India had mostly religious Architecture and apparently, either old Hindu Temples and shrines did not survive or [[Stūpa\|Stupas]] indeed came first (although most of them were repaired periodically during the reign of [[Gupta Empire\|Gupta Empire]] and [[Sātavāhana Empire\|Satvahanas]]). 

[[Gupta Empire\|Gupta Empire]] built temples with bricks instead of stones and hence many could not survive in the original form. They used bricks because finding strong stones in the North was hard due to fertile flat land with not a lot of old rocks, the Himalays are new mountains so the rock is not suited to building. It is far more easier to use red sandstone (limited) for foundation and use mud to manufacture bricks for the main temple.

[[Imperial Chola Dynasty\|Imperial Chola Dynasty]] built many temples - every victory was celebrated with a new temple.
