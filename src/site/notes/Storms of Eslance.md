### Preparation Materials
Welcome to the game & thanks for joining!
Firstly, knowing the system, Discord or the VTT itself is not something that you need to fret about - it is purely MY headache to teach properly.

We shall be using Discord and it is completely fine if you do not know how to use it much, you only should know how to type and join a Voice Channel. 
Here is the invite link: https://discord.gg/g5vrUPQqy8

Apart from this, I would like to tell you that we will create our characters together on Session Zero. I am always available to help on Discord or here on SPG! Looking forward to see you there!

Remember: Any Character Sheet (Demiplane or not) or even a printed character sheet filled in with pen is completely fine. As long as you can use it effectively.
