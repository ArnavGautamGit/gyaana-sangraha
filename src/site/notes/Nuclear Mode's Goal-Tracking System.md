### Progress
Each Day has a Score. The Score for a day is calculated by the following Formula:
$$\Large Score =\dfrac{Task \ Done}{Total \ Tasks}$$
After the Score is Determined, we assign a Rating to the day as a number from 1-5.
The Weekly Rating is the average of all the individual days in a week. The Monthly Rating is the average of Weekly Rating.
