# Armour Slots
> Armour Slots in [[Daggerheart\|Daggerheart]] are the total number of slots on the Character Sheet that can be expended to protect the armoured character from damage.

There are a few rules attached:
- Only one Armour Slot can be expended against one attack.
	- Exceptions when a particular feature allows Otherwise.
- An Armour Slot will reduce the damage to a lower damage threshold.
- The Number of Armour Slots you get are dependent on the Armour Type i.e., Plate Armour will offer more slots than Gambeson Armour.
