# Number System
> Referred to systems of classifying numbers based on their representation; sometimes behaviour. As a chapter, it forms the foundation of mathematics needed to study for SSC CGL.

When we were little, we were all taught the concept of the nuber line in elementary school. First we were taught the concept of the number line which looked more like a ray. One end was fixed at zero and the other end could go on to as long as infinity. These were "[[Whole Numbers\|Whole Numbers]]". Then we were taught how the number line could be stretched below Zero to yield negative numbers. This new number line with both positive and negative numbers was now known as "[[Integers\|Integers]]".

After teaching us Whole Numbers and Integers, we were slowly introduced to concepts of [[Prime Numbers\|Prime Numbers]], [[Co-Prime Numbers\|Co-Prime Numbers]], [[Perfect Square Numbers\|Perfect Squares]], [[Perfect Numbers\|Perfect Numbers]] etc.

We were then taught about how most numbers on the number line can be represented in a P/Q form where Q is non-zero and P is an Integer. These numbers were then labelled "[[Rational Numbers\|Rational Numbers]]". 

While those numbers that exist on the number line may not always fit the definition of Rational Numbers (like square root numbers of Whole Numbers that are not [[Perfect Square Numbers\|Perfect Squares]] such as $\sqrt 2$, $\sqrt3$ etc.) and these numbers were then called the opposite of Rational Numbers i.e., "[[Irrational Numbers\|Irrational Numbers]]". 
Numbers like $\large \pi$ that are non-terminating and non-repeating decimals were included in Irrational Numbers since they cannot be represented as a fraction and don't fit the definition of Rational Numbers. The fraction representation of Pi as $\large\pi \approx \frac{22}{7}$ is an approximation of first few decimal digits.

All Numbers that can be seen on the number line in whatever representative form including the category of Rational and Irrational Numbers were then called as "[[Real Numbers\|Real Numbers]]" while those that could not fit in the category i.e., numbers that do not fit on the number line at all were then called "[[Imaginary Numbers\|Imaginary Numbers]]". Any Number that is a real number + imaginary number is known as being from the category: [[Complex Numbers\|Complex Numbers]].

This meant that all numbers that we have studied are technically complex numbers i.e., we learned after studying for 15 years that Mathematics is complex - something that we knew since childhood. At the same time though, this showcases the mathematical progress of mankind over centuries of work. Complex Numbers form the core basics of many fields like Electrical Engineering (EE), Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE).
