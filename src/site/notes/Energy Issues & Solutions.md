# What are our Energy Issues?
- Energy Requirement & its rate of growth. ([[Energy Issues & Solutions#^1\|#^1]])
- Energy reserves (or sources) and their storage. ([[Energy Issues & Solutions#^2\|#^2]], [[Energy Issues & Solutions#^3\|#^3]])
- Limitations of Conventional sources, including the limit to finite fossil fuels and finite size of energy reservoir.
- Why renewable sources must be preferred? (even though many are not at the level of R&D for mass-adoption and R&D is expensive). ([[Energy Issues & Solutions#^4\|#^4]])

Note: There will be an obvious bias towards Solar Energy and its uses, the Physics behind it since that is the principal part of the syllabus.
# Types of Energy Sources
|  | Non-Renewable | Renewable |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| **Conventional** | Coal, Oil, Gas, Nuclear Fission | Wood, Hydroelectric, Wind |
| **Alternate** | Geothermal, Oil-Shade | Tidal, Solar, Nuclear (Fission+Fusion) |
# The Energy we get from The Sun
The estimte of how much Energy our Sun releases hover around 1400 W/m$\large ^{2}$ based on the following assumptions:
- Earth is completely spherical, 
- Earth has an Albedo value of zero (i.e., $\Large{\alpha} = \large 0\%$) [[Energy Issues & Solutions#^5\|#^5]]
- Earth has no atmosphere to absorb this energy before it hits land 

Keeping the Earth still a perfect sphere but removing the other two assumptions, we find that the average energy (across the globe) comes out to be 980 W/m$\large ^{2}$ per day.

Note: This is an average... Deserts like Sahara and areas like Gujarat would obviously fair better than Delhi or Noida.

# Footnotes
1. India's requirement is set to increase from $\large 58 \times 10^{18} J$  to more than $\large 100 \times 10^{18} J$ in the next 6 years.(i.e., almost 90% increase in $\leq$ 6 years) meanwhile the World's requirement increases from $\large 6.4358 \times 10^{20} J$ to more than $\large 7.3853 \times 10^{20} J$ in the same time span (i.e., roughly 60% increase in $\leq$ 6 years)

2. Coal won't last beyond 80-90 years. Uranium won't last after 500 years. Even though [[Nuclear Fission Reactors\|Nuclear Fission Reactors]] do not produce emisions, [[Uranium\|Uranium]] itself is radioactive and fatal causing storage & logistics problems. A country that has Uranium needs to enrich it past 80% purification of the Uranium to produce electricity (well inside Missile Grade) which creates hurdles in adoption since every country thinks that country is working on [[Nuclear Bombs\|Nuclear Bombs]]. Although this option involves geopolitical and technological hurdles but if we can mine Uranium from the Ocean, it can last thousands of years.

3. [[Lithium\|Lithium]] lasts much longer but mining creates the carbon emissions we are trying to avoid. We cannot mine Lithium from Oceans as of right now, but it can last even longer if we can find a way to do it. Note that Wind Turbine Farms require too much buffer space between turbines which isn't as efficient as other sources of energy previously discussed on a $\large MW \ per \ (km)^2$ basis.

4. The Sun will last for $\large 5.26 \times 10^{26}$ years before it star going Red Giant, hence we can produce electricity from it until our next stage in evolution, almost. Humans will evolve to our next stage yet the same source will still keep giving us electricity from the same source. It is a shame with present technology, we can only harness 10% of the total Solar Energy that falls on a Solar Panel. Efficiency is a problem.

5. Albedo of Earth ($\Large \alpha$) is the light that is reflected back into space as Infrared (IR) without being absorbed. For Earth, $\Large \alpha = \large 30\%$.
