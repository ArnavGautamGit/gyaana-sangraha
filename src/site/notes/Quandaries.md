The word "Quandary" when translated to Hindi means "Dharam Sankat". It is a popular term used in Hindi Literature and Storytelling.

### Quandaries in D&D
The Concept of using Quandaries to create interesting situations in your [[Compendiums/D&D Compendium/Dungeons & Dragons\|D&D]] Games to drive the players to think creatively for solutions is often mentioned in the [[Compendiums/D&D Compendium/Corebooks/D&D Dungeon Master's Guide\|D&D DM's Guide]] and also gives common types of Quandaries  that can be leveraged.

D&D Quandaries can be of many types:
1. ***Ally-based***: There are 2 allies but neither of them can even stand each other let alone work together, the decision-making character(s) must choose one of the two.
2. ***Friend***: Mission or fulfilment of a friend's wish?
3. ***Honour***: Mission by breaking the oath/honour code or failing the mission and risking death.
4. ***Rescue***: Rescue the hostages or catch the villain?
5. ***Respect***: Two allies give conflicting intel, the one you decise to ignore takes it as a sign of distrust. Which do you choose?
