# Pitts India Act of 1784
> Also known as the "East India Company Act of 1784" and many other names, it is a legislation brought in the British Parliament to add additional layers of Government Control and monitoring over the [[British East India Company\|British East India Company]] after rumours of its corruption kept expanding.

Firstly, an additional layer of British Crown's representatives known as the "Board of Control" was created - they would supercede and control the Court of Directors (a body of 24 elected shareholders who previously held the absolute powers over the workings of the company).

Secondly, the [[Governor-General's Executive Council (GGEC)\|Governor-General's Executive Council (GGEC)]] was shortened to just 3 members from a previous count of 4 members (excluding the [[Governor-General of Bengal\|Governor-General]] himself).

### Allegations of Corruption
It is to be noted that while the allegations of corruption are what brought successive control of the Crown over the [[British East India Company\|British East India Company]], these allegations could be planted or intended by the British Government to limit the company's power & avoid it becoming more powerful than the United Kingdom itself.
