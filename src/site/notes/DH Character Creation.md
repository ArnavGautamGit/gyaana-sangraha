### Character Class
Each Class has Class Foundations (Sub-classes) and all classes have two Domains that overlap among classes in circular fashion. When creating a character, the player needs to select one of the Class Foundations and a number of Domain Cards (calculated from their character level). 

Each Class also has a special ability that utilises 3x [[Hope Token\|Hope Token]] to do something special. Not to mention each Class has an extra choice of "Class Item" which is a special non-combat item that helps in building the story. Class Items can be homebrewed freely as long as they are unusable in combat.

Multi-classing in 2 or more classes (max 3) is allowed as per [[DH Multiclassing Rules\|DH Multiclassing Rules]].

The Wizard has *School of Knowledge* and *School of War* as foundations.
- *School of Knowledge* allows players to use magic for understanding the world.
- *School of War* allows players to use magic for violent purposes.

### Character Heritage
Heritage of Characters is based on combining the [[DH Species Ancestry\|DH Species Ancestry]] and the strata of society (reflected by [[DH Community Heritage\|DH Community Heritage]]) the character was born in.

Choose one of both and then write them in your sheet as "Community Species".
Example: "Highborne Human"

### Character Traits
All the traits: [[Agility\|Agility]], [[Strength\|Strength]], [[Finesse\|Finesse]], [[Instinct\|Instinct]], [[Presence\|Presence]] and [[Knowledge\|Knowledge]] require to be given modifiers, there are no absolute scores - just modifiers.

Modifiers are assigned from the standard array of: +2, +1, +1, 0, 0, -1.
Any of the numbers can be assigned to any of the traits. So, one of the traits must be having +2, two must be +1 each, two must be 0 each and one must be -1. Any trait can be given any modifier, some players may like +2 strength, others may like -1, its okay.

### Starting Equipment
At the start of the game, each character can choose their character's armour type, primary weapon & an optional secondary weapon

Armour Type will affect the [[Armour Score\|Armour Score]], [[Armour Points\|Armour Points]] and also depending upon how bulky the chosen armourset is, it may also change the [[Evasion Score\|Evasion Score]]. Armour Points dictate how many times you can subtract the Armour Score from the incoming damage to make it lower than the current threshold and lose less [[Hit Point Slots\|Hit Point Slots]].

Weapons may (and generally do) have special features that alter the traits so be sure to update the values! It is advised to write your [[Armour Score\|Armour Score]] 

### Additional Character Information
Now is the time to calculate your [[Evasion Score\|Evasion Score]]! Starting Evasion Score is different from Class to Class and you can easily add or subtract any modifiers from armour or weapons into your evasion score.

### Character Background
Create and Add a Character Backstory - please give this to your DM as well so they can use it to craft the story with parts of your character's story as a [[Plot Twist\|twist]] or test. There are a few Background Questions that are included in the sheet and may aid you in Backstory Creation or add to the Bakstory.

### Character Experiences
These are small phrases or pieces of wisdom your character has accumulated that they can use through the campaign.

![DH Character Experiences.png](/img/user/Vaulted%20Images/DH%20Character%20Experiences.png)

To use these Experiences, you will also have to describe how to the said experience helps you in the scenario. 
You have to spend 1 [[Hope Token\|Hope Token]] to use 1 Experience - if the [[Game Master\|Game Master]] agrees with your experience being useful.

You can add more experiences as you level up.

### Connections (Optional)
Optional if the party members want to do something like this. Not important. Not helpful. It is basically a section where if you are supposed to know another member of the party before hand, you wirte their name and how you know them in this section.

### Domain Cards
Number of Domain Cards are decided by the character levels and you can carry a maximum of 5 in your loadout + few extras dependent on level.

If you wamt to switch out Domain Cards, each Card has a [[Stress Point\|Stress Point]] indicator, you can mark off the number of Stess Points the new card (which was outside your Loadout) and swap that with another card of the same Domain. This is where 0 stress cards come in handy. They may not be as strong, but when you need them specifically, those cards can be swapped in at 0 Stress Points.

The Kind of Domain Cards you have is dependent on your [[Domains in Daggerheart (DH)\|Domain]] - which is influenced by your [[DH Character Creation#Character Class\|#Character Class]]. You are only able to take 1 domain from a class if you multi-class. See [[DH Multiclassing Rules\|DH Multiclassing Rules]] for more info. This means that you can only get domain cards for that domain.

### Character Levelling
Character Levelling is based on four tiers.
1. Level 1 is considered Tier 1
2. Tier 2: Level 2 to Level 4
3. Tier 3: Level 5 to Level 7
4. Tier 4: Level 8 to Level 10
