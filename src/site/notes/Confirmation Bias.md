# Confirmation Bias
> Tendency to interpret new information so that it becomes compatible with our existing theories, beliefs, convictions i.e., tendency to filter out and reject any information that opposes our viewpoint.

Confirmation Bias works on two kinds of evidence:
1. ***Confirming Evidence***: Evidence which confirms our beliefs i.e., evidences that are in-line with our perspective.
2. ***Disconfirming Evidence***: Evidence which is contrary to our perspective.

### Avoidance 
The Best way to fight Confirmation Bias is to find Disconfirming Evidences for a viewpoint you have formed - challenge the viewpoint instead of harbouring it. Look at both the confirming and disconfirming evidences, see which is more probable and frequent of the two to reach the conclusion - instead of falling into an echo chamber.
