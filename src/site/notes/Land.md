# Land
> In Economics, described as a type of [[Fixed Asset\|Fixed Asset]] & proper fixed dimensions which define the area of land the business owner has the authorisation to build over.

Land is not necessaril a plot of land where a factory will be built like in a traditional manufacturing business, it could be any office or park that can be used for any kind of economic activity that generates [[Gross Revenue\|Gross Revenue]] by facilitating economic activity using it.
It could be something as simple as a house rented out to another family!

### Land Asset vs Land Liability
Generally in business land is considered as an [[Asset\|Asset]] instead of a [[Liability\|Liability]],
But Land can be a liability if it is not being used for economic activity - since the area of land or any structure built on top needs to be maintained and if there is no economic activity occuring on that land (people are simply just living there) then the land is in net loss since money needs to be spent on it while no money is being generated from the same.

### Acquisition
Any Business or Individual can acquire land by [[Leasing\|Leasing]], [[Renting\|Renting]] or [[Purchasing\|Purchasing]] it.
If any individual already owns land they can lease or rent it for money similar to how NSIC land in Okhla is used to host [[Comic Con Delhi 2025\|Comic Con Delhi 2025]] and each following year as well.
