# Problems with D&D
[[Dungeons & Dragons\|D&D]] is a fan favourite game system for [[Table-Top Role-Playing Game\|TTRPGs]] and one of the oldest if not the first ever TTRPG game system. Due to its age and popularity of various media such as Critical Role, Stranger Things among others - it has become fan favourite. 
The first TTRPG system people learn often ends up being D&D.

But it has some problems of its own. 
Firstly, the sheer size of the game means that the player and the GM both have to spend a lot of time reading the rules. D&D over the years has streamlined the player experience but the GM still has a lot to keep in mind. First-time GM-ing is not easy.

Secondly, the sheer number of edge cases and exceptions in the rules and so many rules about the magic system. Many GMs tend not to bother with the ingredients a Wizard needs and if their Wizards even have the ingredients in their inventory.

Thirdly, Multiclassing in D&D more often than not creates a weaker character than just staying single class. Since taking a few levels of another class means they have to let go of the high level abilities of their original class. People get punished for creativity.

Fourthly, Initiative based Combat only makes sense if the people are not on a physical table. The people who are however, will just find it a hassle compared to just going around in circle around the table. Moreover the person at the end of the initiative list will just need to sit and watch which often tends to get boring.

Lastly, Action Economy is broken. Extra Attack is an extra action. Bonus action is not? It is an action where you are limited to what you can do in supplement to what you used for your main action. Not to mention that an enemy with 4 actions per turn will almost always win against a character which has 1 action per turn.

In Comparison, [[Daggerheart\|Daggerheart]] is new & small so it is a lot simpler to learn for GMs and Players alike. It does not have as many edge cases due to having limited content. Multiclassing does not limit them to lower level abilities of both classes, just one type of ability inherited from each class. It does not have Initiative anymore and the action tracker has been removed.
