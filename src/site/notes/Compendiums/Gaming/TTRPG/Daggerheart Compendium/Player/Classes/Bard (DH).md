***GM's Tip:*** Prioritise for [[Presence\|Presence]] trait when building a Bard so that spellcasting & abilities use the best stat & there is a better character in combat situations.

### Domains
Domains of a Class decide what Domain Cards (and abilities) one gets to pick up.
Each class has 2 fixed Domains.
The Bard's domains are: [[Grace\|Grace]] and [[Codex\|Codex]].

### Base Scores
Base [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Evasion Score\|Evasion Score]]: 10
Base [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/General/Hit Point Slots\|Hit Point Slots]]: 5

### Class Items
Each Class also has a specific item they can choose to have - and they will become plot points in the story. They must have one of two.
For a Bard, chose between EITHER *a Romance Novel* OR *a Letter never opened*.

### Bard's Hope - Special Ability
***Make a Scene***: Bard can spend 3x [[Hope Token\|Hope Token]] to temporarily distract any target, giving them a -2 penalty on their [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/General/Difficulty Score\|Difficulty Score]].

### Class Feature - Rally
Once per session, before entering a dangerous situation, you can chose to Rally your teammates and give your allies an extra d6 dice that they can roll. 
The players can choose to roll this "Rally Dice" whose result can be added to an action roll, reaction roll, damage roll or clear the number of [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Stress Point\|Stress Points]] equal to the value rolled on the dice. 
Unused Rally Dice are cleared after the session and the Rally Dice is upgraded to a 1d8 at Level 5.

### Class Foundations (Subclasses)
Both of the foundations use [[Presence\|Presence]] as the Spellcasting trait.

### Background Questions
These help the players think about their character deeper or get a few points of thought to nudge them in the direction to aid character building. Choosing to answer these questions are completely optional:
- Who from your community taught you to have such confidence in yourself?
- You were in love once. Who did you adore, and how did they hurt you?
- You’ve always looked up to another bard. Who are they, and why do you idolize them?

### Connections
Ask your fellow players one of the questions to establish a background of how you know that particular character. Only useful or needed if you want a specific nudge in the direction of connecting characters before the campaign begins. Completely Optional.
- What made you realize we were going to be such good friends?
- What do I do that annoys you?
- Why do you grab my hand at night?
