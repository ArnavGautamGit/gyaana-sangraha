# Fenrir - D&D Character for TWR
Fenrir is my first D&D character I ever made using D&D Beyond (also written as DND Beyond) when I first entered [[The Wandering Realms (TWR)\|The Wandering Realms (TWR)]] in June 2022.
I later moved away from it, but in 2024 wanting to get back there & play D&D again lead me to get confused between the Forgotten Realms and [[The Forgotten Forest\|The Forgotten Forest]].

I deleted Fenrir from Avrae after I lost hope of being able to find my old server again...
I recently in May 2024 was somehow able to spot it & join it again, but now I have added Fenrir for re-submission to the server since my character somehow disappeared sometime ago...

I still have Fenrir on D&D Beyond and I am adding the link to the Character Sheet ([[Fenrir#^1\|#^1]]) for future reference.
