# Vibration Mode of Molecules
> When molecules have excess energy, they vibrate in modes defined by their structure - the [[Bond Length\|Bond Length]], [[Bond Angle\|Bond Angle]], Atoms involved in bonding and their size.

Mainly there are 3 types of Vibration Modes:
1. Symmetric Stretch
2. Asymmetric Stretch
3. Bend (also called Scissoring)

A molecule with $\large N$ atoms, if non-linear has $\large3N-6$ modes of vibration whereas if it is linear, it has $\large3N-5$ modes of vibration.

## Vibration Modes - why study them?
Vibration Modes help understand which molecules are [[Infrared Activity\|IR Active]] and which are not. 
The molecules that are IR Active are the ones that contribute to Infrared Activity.

And since we have studied that a particular molecule can have multiple vibration modes, we know that there are multiple overtones and combinations of different modes among adjacent molecules from any given sample. Hence, there is a range of possible [[Infrared Activity\|Infrared Activity]]. It is not black and white.

## Absorbtion Frequency of a Diatomic Molecule
If molecules can absorb frequencies of Infrared in accordance with [[Conditions for Molecular Energy Transfer\|Conditions for Molecular Energy Transfer]], there must be a frequency of Absorbtion.

$$\Large\nu = \dfrac{1}{2\pi c}\sqrt{\dfrac{k(m_1 m_2)A_V}{m_1m_2}}$$
Note: 
$\large m_1$ and $\large m_2=$ [[Atomic Mass\|Atomic Masses]] of vibrating atoms
$\large c =$ [[Speed of Light\|Speed of Light]] $\large=3\times10^8 \ m/s$ 
$\large V=$ [[Wave Number\|Wave Number]] (in $\large cm^{-1}$)
$\large A_V$ = [[Avogadro's Number\|Avogadro's Number]] $\large=6.023 \times 10^{23} \ \text{atoms per mole}$ 
$\large k=$ [[Bond Strength\|Bond Strength]] $\large=5b\times10^{5} \ dynes/cm$ where $\large b=$ number of bonds (i.e., 1-3)
