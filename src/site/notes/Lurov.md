# Lurov
> Original Setting made to create an entirely new world with tons of potential for varied play while limiting the players & GMs to a few ancestries per kingdom to make it easier to run and simpler to play! 

It is also reflective of the tribal nature of life on Earth where certain races preferred to live with people like themselves - using it as an anchor to provide realism.
