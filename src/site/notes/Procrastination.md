# Procrastination
> I learned about Procrastination & its ill effects from [[Marcus Aurelius\|Marcus Aurelius]] through his writings in his diaries of [[Meditations\|Meditations]] where he argues that if you are procrastinating, it means you are wasting life.

> [!quote] *Meditations - Book 2, Verse 4*
> *"Think of your long hours of Procrastination, and of many opportunities given you by the Gods, but left unused. Surely it is high time to understand the Universe of which you are a part, and the Ruler of that Universe, of who you are an emanation; that a timelimit is set to your days, which if you use them not for your enlightenment, will depart, as you yourself will, and return no more."*
> ~ Marcus Aurelius

The time that you have on Earth is limited, one day you will die - Procrastination means you have effectively wasted a day in not understanding your purpose, the Universe, [[Providence\|Providence]] and work on your purpose in life and are one day closer to the end of your life.

Marcus argues that just like one day you will die to never return, the time you have wasted shall never return. The same lines could also be interpreted as: just like the day you wasted shall never return, so once you inevitably reach the time of your death, you shall never return & will be left to regret as you die.

Then how does one work? Marcus in Verse 7 mentions that one must take breaks of leisure here or there while you work to add something to your knowledge. Pay no heed to vacillations (stuff around you).
The full verse is below:

> [!quote] *Meditations - Book 2, Verse 7*
> *"Cares from without distract you: take leisure, then, to add some good thing to your knowledge; have done with vacillation, and avoid the other error \[i.e., Procrastination]. For triflers, too, are they who, by their activities, weary themselves in life, and have no settled aim to which they may direct, once and for all, their every desire and project."*
> ~ Marcus Aurelius
