# Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi
The real name of the "Mahātmā" Gandhi.
The name (for those who do not speak Hindi or Gujarati) is pronounced as "Mōhandāsa Karamchanda Gāndhī".

He led the [[Indian National Congress\|Indian National Congress]] for a long time and was the main face of The Gandhian Moderates - the people who believed in the naïve thought that peaceful protests could actually cause the British to leave India.

Before Arriving in India, Gandhi was a lawyer in South Africa. Who made sure his brother got rid of his [[Shikhā\|Shikhā]] when he got to South Africa.
He wrote of the meeting with Swami Shraddhanand where his lack of a shikha left the Swami perplexed:
> He was pained to miss the shikha on my head and the sacred thread about my neck and said: "It pains me to see a believing Hindu, going without a sacred thread and the shikha. These are the two eternal symbols of Hinduism and every Hindu ought to wear them"
> ...
> The Shikha was considered obligatory by elders. On the eve of going to England, however, I got rid of the shikha, lest when I was bareheaded, it should expose me to ridicule, and make me look, as I then thought, a barbarian in the eyes of the Englishmen. In fact this cowardly feeling carried me so far that in South Africa, I got my cousin, Chhaganlal Gandhi, who was religiously wearing the shikha to do away with it.
> ~ Gandhi wrote in *"The Story of My Experiments with Truth"*, Part V (page 382)

While in South Africa, Gandhi (according to Arthur Herman) thought of himself as "a Briton first, and an Indian second" {Source: [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi#^1\|#^1]]}

# His Family Background
As it was a practice in noble families to keep the name of their father as their middlename (to show lineage), Mohandas's middlename was derived from his father's name - Karamchand Uttamchand Gandhi, who was a *dīwān* in the court of [[The Princely State of Porbander\|The Princely State of Porbander]] until 1873 after which he became the *dīwān* of a much bigger princely state: [[The Princely State of Rajkot\|The Princely State of Rajkot]]. 
At the time, being the most important noble in a small princely state for a few generations (starting with Gandhi's great grandfather) was rich enough but to then get promoted to a princely state which dwarfs the old one means Gandhi came from one of the most privileged families in the entire country.
