# United Nations (U.N)
> United Nations is a global [[Collective Security\|Collective Security]] framework made after the failure of the [[League of Nations\|League of Nations]] in stopping [[The Second World War (WW2)\|The Second World War (WW2)]] from happening.

Although it was made to be more stringent than the [[League of Nations\|League of Nations]] in ensuring world peace. This Organisation ensuring "Collective Security" could not ensure the "Private Security" of its own secretary from almost being bombed to death in Lebanon during Isreali strikes. Neither could the UN punish Israel for this demeanor. It can be understood just how dysfunctional the League must have been back in the day.

### Founding
The UN was created in 1945 and the global acceptance was ensured via most states signing [[The Charter of the United Nations (1945)\|The Charter of the United Nations (1945)]] to gain membership. Now new members have to be approved by getting diplomatic support from the existing members similar to how back in the day we needed a referral or person to "introduce" us if we wanted a bank account in a private bank.

### Subsidiary Bodies
Over the period of time since 1945, the UN has grown many subsidiaries - even new ones beyond those declared in the [[Charter of the United Nations (1945)\|Charter of the United Nations (1945)]]. These bodies can only be approached by [[State (United Nations)\|UN Member States]], not by individuals or organisations.

These Bodies include:
[[United Nations General Assembly (U.N.G.A)\|United Nations General Assembly (U.N.G.A)]]
[[United Nations Security Council (U.N.S.C)\|United Nations Security Council (U.N.S.C)]]
[[International Court of Justice (ICJ)\|International Court of Justice (ICJ)]]
[[Economic Social Council (E.S.C)\|Economic Social Council (E.S.C)]]
[[Trusteeship Council\|Trusteeship Council]]
[[U.N Secretariat\|U.N Secretariat]]

### Declarations, Laws & Legislations
> see full note in: [[International Law\|International Law]]

There have been various declarations and legislations that have been introduced by the UN. Each Declaration must pass the voting in the [[United Nations General Assembly (U.N.G.A)\|UNGA]] without being vetoed by the [[United Nations Security Council (U.N.S.C)\|UNSC]] and if it passes then it must be signed by those member states that agree to it. 

Those [[State (United Nations)\|UN Member States]] that are not signatories to a particular convention cannot be sued for not abiding by the conventions they did not sign.

A small list of major Conventions in the UN:
[[Genocide Convention\|Genocide Convention]]
[[Law of the Sea\|Law of the Sea]]
[[Convention against Torture\|Convention against Torture]]
among others
