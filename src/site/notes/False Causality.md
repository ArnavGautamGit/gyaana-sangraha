# False Causality
> Tendency to arrive at wrong conclusions abbout a potential cause for an event. It is generally rooted in confusing Causality and Correlation. Correlation between two events does not mean one causes the other.

***Examples***: 
1. "The more the firefighters called out to fight the fire, the greater the fire damage" is how a lot of the "studies" are written - the fire damage is more due to bigger fires which need more firefighters.
2. "Prolongued stay at Hospitals affect patients adversely." Even if we assume the infection rate in the [[Intensive Care Unit (ICU)\|Intensive Care Unit (ICU)]] to be massively higher than it is, the patients who have serious illnesses stay longer and staying longer doesn't make your illness worse.

### Similar Variants
[[Fundamental Attribution Error\|Fundamental Attribution Error]]
[[Association Bias\|Association Bias]]

### Avoidance
Correlation $\large\neq$ Causality.
Sometimes what is presented is the opposite of what is happening.
Think and try to find the causality of connected events yourself.
