# Demand
> A concept of [[Economics\|Economics]] where people at large are willing & able to buy your product that the Entrepreneur is selling. 

Demand has three characteristics: 
1. Desire to Possess to Purchase
2. Willingness to Pay for the purchase
3. Able to make the purchase (have enough money)

### Price Elasticity of Demand
Demand reduces as Price of the product increases (given other factors remain constant). Demand of a Ferrari is probably lower than the demand for a Suzuki due to less people being able to purchase and maintain a supercar like Ferrari.
Exception to these exist as [[Veblin Goods\|Veblin Goods]] and [[Giffin Goods\|Giffin Goods]].
$$\Large \text{Demand} \propto \dfrac{1}{\text{Price}}$$
$$\Large \text{E}_\text{P} = \dfrac{\text{\% change in Demand}}{\text{\% change in Price}}$$

There are three categories we can create based on this:
1. Perfectly Elastic - Demand changes infinitely on change in Price (based on hypothetical situation)
2. Unitary Elastic - Percentage change in Price is equal to absolute percentage change in demand in the same/opposite direction.
3. Relatively Elastic - Percentage Change in Demand is more than percentage change in price.
4. Relatively Inelastic - Percentage Change in Demand is less than Percentage Change in Price.
5. Perfectly Inelastic - Demand has no effect regardless of change in price (such as life-saving medication)

### Income Elasticity of Demand
Demand Increases as Buyer's Income increases (given other factors remain constant) due to the increase in the ability of customer to pay (increase in [[Purchasing Power\|Purchasing Power]]).

$$\Large \text{Demand} \propto \text{Income}$$
$$\Large \text{E}_\text{P} = \dfrac{\text{\% change in Demand}}{\text{\% change in Income}}$$

### Cross-Product Elasticity of Demand
Demand of one product may change the demand for the product depending upon if they are companion goods or competitor goods.
$$\Large \text{E}_\text{P} = \dfrac{\text{\% change in Demand of Good}_1}{\text{\% change in Demand of Good}_2}$$
