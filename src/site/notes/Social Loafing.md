# Social Loafing
> Tendecy to put lesser (physical/mental) effort and take lesser accountability while taking the most risk while in a group since individual performance, accountaility and risky beahviour are not visible in the group effort.

Discovered by a French Engineer Maximilian Ringelmann in 1913 while he studied behaviour of horses that they do not put their 100% effort when pulling a load while in a group but seem to exert 100% effort when pulling alone.

When tested on humans, he found it is true for humans too.

The reasoning he gave was simple:
Since individual performance is not directly visible, it blends into the group effort and in a moment of self-awareness the individuals realise this and avoid giving their 100% subconsciously since it won't be seen anyway.

When meetings exceed a certain number (say 20 people) the person is not mentally at their 100% peak effort, energy, productivity whatever.
