# Inflation
> A phenomenon where the prices of [[Goods\|Goods]] and Services increase exponentially year-on-year. It is also said what Compounding creates, Inflation eats. 

Inflation is considered better than deflation for any economy - since it shows that the public's demand for goods is increasing. Too much inflation is also bad for the economy since the prices of [[Giffin Goods\|Staple Goods]] grow beyond the disposable income of a big section of people.

Once upon a time being a crorepati was rare, now it is getting a lot less rare because inflation along with [[Economic Growth\|Economic Growth]] has made the value of 1 Crore of 2025 a lot lower than 1 Crore of 1985.

Negative Inflation is called [[Economic Deflation\|Economic Deflation]]
