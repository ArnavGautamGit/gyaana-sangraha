# Insightful Bruce Lee Quotes
> This page aims to list all of the best quotes of Bruce lee that I could find and authentically attribute to him. The list is in no particular order.

It was extremely amazing to see how Mr. Lee was so ahead of his time and some things he said still had a profound effect on what I say or believe today in 2025.
He brought a little bit of a Chinese Confucianist Philosophy with himself which was a great part about him that he expressed himeself beautifully.

I have tried my best to draw initial insights from the quotes and how I can apply them to my life the best.
Many notes will link back here.

### Quotes from the Pierre Burton Show in 1971
>[!quote]
>*"Absorb what is useful, discard what is useless and always add something of your own"*
>~ Bruce Lee
{ #1}


This quote felt like it particularly resonated with me that maybe I was a bit too harsh on [[Dr. Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar\|Ambedkar]] and what he did. I should act a bit more maturely and only absorb the best from people since if I focus too much on someone's mistakes I will end up wasting my own time. We are too quick to add something of our own to the topic without actually thinking about what we would like to incorporate into our lives and what we don't want to. This leads us to blindly start debating in an effort to put the person, situation or anything else we are debating into a defined box of black or white while life is always going to be a shade of grey/gray however its spelled.

> *"Empty your mind. Be Formless. Shapeless. Like Water. Now you put water into a cup, it becomes the cup. You put water in a bottle, it becomes a bottle. You put it in a teapot, it becomes the teapot. Now water can flow or it can crash... Be like water, my friend."*
> ~ Bruce Lee

Bruce Lee makes a great point on being versatile in many skills & moulding yourself according to the situation without compromising on your capability to defend yourself and work hard (comparing it to crashing water).

> [!quote]
> *"It is about expressing yourself honestly"*
> ~ Bruce Lee defines Martial Arts
{ #3}


Bruce Lee also mentioned how he does not believe in a particular style because it restricts the practitioner of martial art into a particular doctrine. He believes all humans are unique and hence should follow what was mentioned in the first quote about absorbing the useful from each style and creating your own.
