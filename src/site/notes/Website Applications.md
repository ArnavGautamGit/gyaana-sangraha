Examples: Habitica, YouTube, Google Services (Meet, Maps, Mail etc.)

2. ***Back-end***: Also called the "Server Side" is the part that no one except the server sees.
	1. Handles Authentication, API Requests among other things.
3. ***Database***: Also called "DB" is the part of the server that stores all the data
