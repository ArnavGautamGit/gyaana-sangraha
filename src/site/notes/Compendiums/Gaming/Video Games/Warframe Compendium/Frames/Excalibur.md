# Excalibur - The First Warframe!
At any given point one should choose Excalibur as their starter frame and then go in and get Volt from their Clan's Dojo Research (in th Dojo's Tenno Lab).

Excalibur is great since it allows you to use Radial Blind and Exhaulted Blade one after the other to one shot any enemy - especially useful when going through Planet Junctions where you will face other Warframes guarding the Solar Rails that need to be realligned but their programming in such that they have to fight you. 

To Mod Excalibur - do these things:
1. Decrease Energy Drain and Maximise Ability Duration and Ability Damage
2. Mod the Exhaulted Blade to deal more damage.
3. To save mod slots, get Arcanes.
4. Once finished The New War Quest, go ahead and claim Archons on Archon Hunt.
