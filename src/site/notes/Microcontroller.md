# Microcontroller
> A Microcontroller is essentially an [[Integrated Circuit (IC)\|Integrated Circuit (IC)]] Chip that is programmed to a do a specific task. 

By reducing the size and cost compared to a design that uses a separate [[Microprocessor\|Microprocessor]], memory, and input/output devices, microcontrollers make it economical to digitally control even more devices and processes.

### Applications
The majority of microcontrollers in use today are embedded in devices and machinery equipment. Microcontrollers are used in au tomatically controlled products and devices, such as automobile cruise control; implantable medical devices; remote controls; office machines; appliances; power tools; toys; automatic door opener; and remotely controlled airplanes.

### Working
A Microcontroller connnects to all the sensors, takes data from said sensors & controls the outputs machinery from blades on a mixer-grinder to control surfaces of an aircraft.
Since it has a small sixe, responds real time (miniscule storage if any) & low power requirement of around 0.5 to 1 Watt, we can operate a Microcontroller on Battery Power as well.

A real world example for a Microcontroller is the [[Arduino\|Arduino]] board. It has many sensors, pin headers and one USB port with small amounts of storage to store any code we may have.

### Architecture
Microcontrollers are built on the same [[Computer Architecture\|Computer Architecture]] types which may be differentiated on the basis of: (1) Total number of Bits, (2) whether the [[Memory Architecture\|Memory Architecture]] is based on [[Von Neumann Architeture\|Von Neumann Architeture]] or [[Harvard Architecture\|Harvard Architecture]], (3) whether the Instruction Set is based on [[Compex Instruction Set Computer (CISC)\|CISC]] or [[Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC)\|RISC]].

### Programming
The Microcontroller (as previously mentioned) will have very limited storage, so the compiled code must be able to fit the limited storage & memory we have. 

To have things running lightweight, any [[Embedded System\|Embedded System]] like the Microcontroller, [[Microprocessor\|Microprocessor]], [[Graphical Processing Unit (GPU)\|Graphical Processing Unit (GPU)]] among others utilise low level languages like [[C\|C]] and [[C++\|C++]]. Some like the [[Raspberry Pi\|Raspberry Pi]] accept & use [[Python\|Python]] as well.

The Programming Procedure goes as follows:
1. Write the code in compatible languages.
2. Debug the Code
3. Compile the Code in Binary
4. Transfer the file to Microcontroller

It is only after all these steps are completed in order that a Microcontroller or any other [[Embedded System\|Embedded System]] can run the code & perform the tasks it was given.
