# S-Boxes
> Also called a "Substitution-Box", it is a mechanism to obscure the relationship between Plaintext and [[Cryptographic Key\|Cryptographic Key]]. 

It is implemented as a smaller analogous to Log Tables - taking certain input bits ($m$) and returning certain output bits ($n$) where both of them are not necesssarily equal.
