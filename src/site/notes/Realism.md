# Realism
> In [[International Studies\|International Studies]], it is defined as an inherently [[Pessimism\|Pessimistic]] Philosophy which states that Humans are inherently greedy and selfish beings who will discard any rules (when push comes to shove) and act as opportunistic hypocrites which is why the nature of International Politics is [[Anarchy\|Anarchic]]. 

Many Realist thinkers argue that It is imperative that while the expectation of other [[State (United Nations)\|Member States]] to behave in an [[Idealism\|Ideal]] manner should not be discarded, it is equally important to acknowledge that it is best to prepare for the worst.

Some Realist thinkers go far enough to appeal to their followers to discard morals (or use them as traps and use them as machinations for claiming [[Moral Superiority\|Moral Superiority]] as per the convenience of the state to act [[Holier Than Thou\|Holier Than Thou]])
The USA across their Party Lines are considered to be Realists because that is the nature of the [[U.S Deep State\|U.S Deep State]].

Realism has the following primary branches:
[[Morgenthau's Realism\|Morgenthau's Realism]]
[[Machiavellian Realism\|Machiavellian Realism]]
