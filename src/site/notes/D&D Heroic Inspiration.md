# D&D Heroic Inspiration
> A part of the Basic Rules Section of the [[Compendiums/D&D Compendium/Corebooks/D&D Player's Handbook\|D&D Player's Handbook]], it is a rule that allows the players to reroll any dice immediately after rerolling it BUT the players have to use the new roll - even if its worse. 

Only usecase is to try and save yourself from Natural 1s unless you roll a Natural 1 again.
Why do I say that? Because certain restrictions do apply on Heroic Inspiration.

Conditions: 
- Heroic Inspiration can only be used once until acquired again.
- One character can only possess one inspiration. You cannot possess more than 1 inspirations at the same time.
- It does not stack but can be passed on to a nearby character who does not have it.

### Hero Stones & Hero Statues - Homebrew Addition
In my campaigns, I have borrowed from the Ancient Indian tradition of dedicating Rock Engravings and Pillar Edicts to particular heroes which write down their historic act for the entire world to remember for as long as that rock or pillar survives.

***Hero Stones*** are written engravings that have the story of the hero inscribed, some may have an artistic representation here or ther but it is painted art. Mechanically, these bestow Heroic Inspiration or any equivalent (if non-D&D system) for the first time of that character hearing/reading the story.

***Hero Statues*** have a 3D sculpture of the hero (generally life-sized) with the story engraved in writing in the pedestal of the statue. Mechanically, they are much much more insane. 
As long as you are within a certain radius of the statue, your character has heroic inspiration for that roll. However you can only use it once per roll but as long as you are right next to it, you can use it again on your next roll.
