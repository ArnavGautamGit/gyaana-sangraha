# How to land your First Job
> Note about helping people land their First or Second Job or Internship right out of college.

It is basically a collection of things I have learnt from conversations with many different people and watching quite a few videos on Tips after I was looking for jobs after I left my first job at [[AventIQ\|AventIQ]]. 

## Figure out your Interests First
In the video titled [Honest Roadmap for 17-24 Year Olds](https://youtu.be/_IzDpyFdXpE?feature=shared) the YT creator aims at providing youngsters a roadmap for what they need to do in order to get their first job.

There are a few steps:
1. Figure out and make a list of all Skills you are good at.
2. Assess which ones have job postings
3. Assess the number of job postings for each prospective career
4. Analyse Supply and Demand - the number of people applying vs number of openings.
5. Finalise those prospective jobs where the supply is lowest compared to demand.
6. Check out some job postings and see what skills are demanded
7. Learn the skills from free sources like YouTube.

The first few steps are also echoed in the book "[[Ikigai - The Japanese Secret to a Long and Happy Life\|Ikigai]]" which as a book is absolutely useless and the [[Ikigai (Japanese Concept)\|Concept of Ikigai]] is unexplained but probably means this same thing. 

Both the YT creator and writers of Ikigai stop right after step 7 or say one can "start applying" but the reality is that is not how you land a job in a market as overloaded as tech. You application will get burried under thoudands of others. 

Meeting face to face means that you can actually show how you are different than others since if text on paper could define a person instead of an in-person meeting then Video Calling & Video-Conferencing would never be developed.

## Turn to your Network to get a job in area of interest
I recently talked a friend of mine, he went to the USA for his degree & currently is staying there on Work Permit. We were on a call discussing the happenings of life and shared a few things which (at least to me) sounded new.

While in the conversation he told me a few things:
***Firstly***, He told me to utilise the network of my ex-colleagues, college friends, college seniors, High School Friends.

> [!cite] Build a Network if switching fields else keep expanding it
> "Get in touch with other kids from school like \[Gave a few examples] and try and ask them if they have some openings in their department or workplace. Visit a few conventions or hackathons or entrepreneurial events where entrepreneurs come to visit & showcase ideas. Ask them about problems they might be facing and solve them. The attitude of giving solutions and helping them before asking for a job will make them more likely to help you and provide a job"
> 
> ~ My Friend (I won't name him without his permission)

***Secondly***, he told me was to never leave a company on bad terms and never intentionally make enemies. Since you do not know who can help you at which point of time.

> [!cite] Keep up with your network & do not let go.
> "Never end things on a bad note and cut-off contact with people you meet. Anyone can come in handy at any time. Even after you part ways, keep following them on Social Media or wish them on a festival like Diwali/Holi/Christmas."
> 
> ~ Same Friend (I won't name him without his permission)

We later summarised our conversation to a few actionable points:
1. Update your LinkedIn and show how you are not doing a job anymore
	1. Showcase your projects on LinkedIn & learn in public.
2. Go to a Hackathon/Event - meet people & network. Make a post about it
	1. "Had a great conversation with @XYZ when I met them at \#ABC-Hackathon"
	2. Add the people on LinkedIn as connections
3. Keep in touch with High School & College Friends.
4. Chill out in life. You are 22, you have time.
