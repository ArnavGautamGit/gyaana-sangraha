# Orc (DH)
> A [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Ancestries/DH Species Ancestry\|DH Species Ancestry]] of square-featured humanoids with boar-like tusks protruding from their lower jaws. These tusks are not for eating. They tend to be muscular no matter their size. Often potrayed to be some shade of green, they are likely to be in other shades depending on the local surroundings.

Orcs decorate their tusks just like how [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Ancestries/Infernis (DH)\|Infernis (DH)]] decorate their horns and [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Ancestries/Galapa (DH)\|Galapa (DH)]] decorate their shells. They are very common across TTRPGs and they have been popularised by Tolkien's books and the Lord of The Rings books & movies. They are between 5 to 7 feet tall.

> [!example] Orcs as the largest Colonising Force
> Orcs are feared across Lurov as they are seen as a colonising force which attacks and destroys land. Orcs often attack lands with Desert or Steppe areas since that is their natural habitat but it is also true that Orcs have a particular hatred of [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Ancestries/Elf (DH)\|Elves]] & the fued has been on for so long that they don't even remember the original fued and both sides are too egoistic to let go of the grudge - the Orc Armies are now moving towards Forest Lands since they need wood and coal to construct proper housing.

On taking Orc, you gain the following Ancestry Features:
- ***Sturdy***: Attacks against you have disadvantage when only one 1x [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/General/Hit Point Slots\|HP Slot]] remains.
- ***Tusks***: After making a successful Melee Attack, the Orc can choose to gore their target, adding a 1d6 to the attack, this does NOT scale with [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Proficiency\|Proficiency]].

Average Lifespan of an Orc is 150 years.
