# Unified Threat Management (UTM)
> Hardware used in [[Computer Networks\|Computer Networks]] which combines [[Firewall\|Firewall]], [[Intrusion Detection System (IDS)\|IDS]], [[Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)\|IPS]], [[Virtual Private Network (VPN)\|VPN]], spam filters among other devices used in [[Network Security\|Network Security]] in one product.

Also referred to as UTMs and often used in small to medium sized networks as a one-stop solution for centralised security management. Large corporations avoid them due to customisation limitations.
