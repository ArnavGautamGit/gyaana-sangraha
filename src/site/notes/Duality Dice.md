# Duality Dice
> The Dice used to play [[Daggerheart\|Daggerheart]].

The Duality Dice are basically a 2d12 where both the d12 dice mean something unique i.e., one of them is your Hope Dice, the other is your Fear Dice.

When you roll a check or save with the Duality Dice, if the combined score (with any applicable bonuses) clear the DC, you succeed the roll and if the combined score is below the DC, you fail (like in any other [[Table-Top Role-Playing Game\|TTRPG]]).

Regardless of the success or failure, if you role higher with the Hope Dice, you get +1 [[Hope Token\|Hope Token]]. On the contrary, a +1 [[Fear Token\|Fear Token]] is awarded to the [[Game Master\|Game Master]] if the Fear Dice Rolls higher.

- On a Success/Failure with [[Hope Token\|Hope Token]], you clear/fail the check and get a [[Hope Token\|Hope Token]]. Minor Consequences for failing which can be sorted by spending the Hope.
- On a Success/Failure with Fear, you clear/fail the challenge and you can face consequences for giving away the [[Fear Token\|Fear Token]].
- If Both dice roll the same number (regardless of if they clear the DC), the character gets a Critical Success!!! Character gets +1 [[Hope Token\|Hope Token]], +1 [[Stress Point\|Stress Point]] and extra cool stuff.
