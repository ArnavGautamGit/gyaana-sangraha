# Attack Mode (Course)
> A Productivity Course sold by YouTube Personality, Author and Motivational Speaker - Shwetabh Gangwar.

Everything learnt from this course is documented here in this note.

### Notes from the Course.
[[Neuroplasticity\|Neuroplasticity]] - when you do a task, the brain makes a new connection. These connections solidify further and this behaviour becomes a part of you. Evolve your workplan & follow it consistently to create better habits and achieve more output. Your Old Behaviour is still there where you can fall into again. Goal is to make it so latent by reinforcing this new way of life that falling back into that hellhole is near impossible.

[[Pareto Principle\|Pareto Principle]] - 80% results come from 20% factors. Use Introspection to find these factors and build on top of them to Evolve the System as demanded by achieving success via Neuroplasticity.

[[Action not Reward\|Action not Reward]] - Refrain from working for a reward since when you work for your own selfish motives to obtain for some reward or for money, you are more likely to fall for distractions because the prospects of earning a similar reward pleases you (in the short-term) just as much as the original would (if not more) especially if the distractions are addicting. Pick an external source of motivation - God or Nation or Legacy to which you could dedicate all your work to. 

[[Trash Your Plans\|Trash Your Plans]] - Its all about the Journey and not the Destination. Don't take away the adventure of the journey by confining yourself to "plans" based on pre-conceived notions or advice from random people. This plan will be very linear & follow clear and concise steps. Anyone who has achieved the same goal would tell you the reality does not follow that linear trajectory. Moreover, you are increasing the chances of spiralling into a panic when the reality will deviate even a slight bit from the linear "plan" and you will probably lose hope thinking that you cannot do it.

[[Repair not Blame\|Repair not Blame]], Since we have [[Trash Your Plans\|Trashed our plans]] it is okay to make mistakes as long as we learn from them and improve ourselves and our productivity system but it does not mean deviating from the goal is fine.

[[Fix not Fixate\|Fix not Fixate]] - Do not fixate on something and overthink, whenever an old embarassing thing comes to your mind, you should think about "Can I Fix it?" and "Can I learn from this to be better?" If yes, take the learnings and go home. If no, then it isn't worth your time.

[[Growth Mindset\|Growth Mindset]] - Develop a Growth Mindset.

[[Regions of Improvement\|Regions of Improvement]] (Classified)
