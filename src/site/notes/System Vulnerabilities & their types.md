# System Vulnerabilities & their types
> Systems may have multiples types of [[Cyber Security Terminology#Vulnerabilities\|Vulnerabilities]] that exist. There is a search engine of vulnerabilities available on [[Shodan\|Shodan]].

There are 4 classes of Vulnerabilities:
1. ***Hardware Vulnerabilities***: The System & its hardware is vulnerable to physical damage such as being set on fire, power outages, short circuits and intentional or unintentional spilling of liquids on them.
2. ***Software Vulnerabilities***: The System Software is vulnerable to [[Computer Malware\|Computer Malware]], Backdoors and Interception Devices such as Keyloggers. It is also vulnerable to deletion due to failure in [[Configuration Management\|Configuration Management]] and information leaks.
3. ***Data Vulnerabilities***: The System Data is vulnerable to be wire-tapped, stolen through trash receptacles or bribing key employees among other forms of data leaks. Popular attack to exploit Data Vulnerabilities is the Salami attack - the criminal steals a very miniscule amount (say ₹1) from 100,000 bank accounts giving him/her ₹1 lakh.
4. ***Network Vulnerabilities***: The System Network may be vulnerable to [[Ping Sweep\|Ping Sweep]] and [[Nmap\|Nmap]] - now the attacker would know about the number of computers they can hit due to the Network being vulnerable.
