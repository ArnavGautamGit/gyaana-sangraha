# Visiting महासु देवता मन्दिर, बिसोई

The way to reach the temple from [[Nāgthāt (नागथात)\|Nāgthāt (नागथात)]] is to take a left after the market when you see the board which tells you to take a left. It says the name of the temple in red Devanagri text on white background. The road was under-construction and is going to be properly built later.

The Trip to the temple was very good and I loved it. Our car's battery was almost dead but papa decided to keep the car on the entire time. We clicked photos inside the temple and did *parikrama* and returned. I donated some money to the temple, we were obviously given prasad.

At the time of [[Jalebi-testing in the market\|Jalebi-testing in the market]], when we went to the next market to drink tea, the shopkeeper in a conversation told us that the people of the village take the permission of the devta whenever they leave the town for longer periods of time.

There are two goats in there for that purpose, who when sprinkled with water - may jerk the water off or lay down which mean yes or no respectively.
