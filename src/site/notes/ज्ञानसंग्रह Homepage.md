# Welcome to ज्ञानसंग्रह !!

ज्ञानसंग्रह is made of two main Sanskrit Words: 
1. ज्ञान (Knowledge or Wisdom) 
2. संग्रह (Repository)

Putting them together you can easily piece it together that this is a Knowledge Repository. You are free to press Ctrl+K (or Cmd+K for Mac Users) to open Search if you want to look for something specific or click on the Hamburger/menu icon on the top left to open the list of notes to check them out!

The First few thing you should know about me are the following:
- I am ready to offend people in my quest of the truth because I believe that one must ask uncomfortable & offensive questions in order to uncover the truth.
- Please take all that is present here as opinions based on facts I discovered. Please avoid being triggered.
	- I may be surrounded by people who say the same things & reinforce the same ideas. 
	- Or in an extreme-but-condensed way: "I could be in an echo chanber and I may not know it".
	- Additions of context and facts from a new perspective is encouraged as long as the input is provided in a respectful manner.
- I use tags, links and other properties in my notes very liberally. It is advised to look into [[A Description of all Tags I used\|A Description of all Tags I used]].
- I usually do not write much in Politics, but since people tend to follow, unfollow, like, dislike and even form friendships on the basis of Political Opinions, then I think I need to make things clear:
	- Politically, I am both [[Being Anti-Ambedkar\|Anti-Ambedkar]] and [[Being Anti-Gandhi\|Anti-Gandhi]] - if you file a court case on me for those reasons, this page will be quoted in court. I am what is popularly called as a "Centrist" - my opinions do not allign a 100% with either side of the Political Spectrum Needless to say - I hold both the Congress/AAP/INDI Alliance and the BJP equally.

# Intro to the संग्रह (Repository)
I am a proud Indian who believes that Sanskrit is the way of reviving the unity of my country which lays fractured in the wake of Internet Echo Chambers.
As a proud Sanskrit-learner I have divided the entire Repository into a Sanskrit Theme. 

The primary language of the Repository is English for the reason that English is the language of the Internet and insures maximum penetration in the same. 
I would have loved to make notes in Sanskrit but only 25,000 or so people would understand it. (As of 29th September 2024,the number of Sanskrit speakers in the world are around 25,000)
