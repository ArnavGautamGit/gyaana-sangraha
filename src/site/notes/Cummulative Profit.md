# Cummulative Profit
> Defined as the TOTAL profit earned since the inception of any business. It could be understood as the sum of all the profit a business has earned since being founded.

Cummulative Profit is usually calculated using either the [[EBITDA\|EBITDA]] (Operating Profit) or the [[Profit-before-Tax (PBT)\|Profit-before-Tax (PBT)]] (only if the business has few assets & no debts since inception) but the calculations using EBITDA are more prevalently used.

The Cummulative Profit of any business is more important of a statistic for newer startups and companies which recently became [[EBITDA\|EBITDA]]-positive. It is also used in conjunction with quoting or predicting [[Break-Even Point\|Break-Even Point]].
