# Airspace
> Defined as the Volume of Atmosphere over the land. 
> In case of an individual home or land owner, the height of how far above you can claim airspace is decided by the Constitution and Laws of the area/state.

The General Understanding is such that in case of private land ownership, in most places, people are told that the volume of air equivalent to their land's area extended to the height of 50m above the ground level is considered theirs.

> In [[International Studies\|International Studies]], it is understood as the area over the land of a [[State (United Nations)\|United Nations Member State]] is considered their airspace which cannot be violated. Permissions have to be sought before flying civil or military aircrafts through another State's Airspace.

States have a history of restricting other countries from using their Airspace. A very popular example is Pakistan restricting India from using their airspace - this means that Indian flights have to go around Pakistan, costing more fuel. This is why flights westward from India are more expensive than the flights going eastward.
