# Fix not Fixate
> A Mindset and mental habit introduced in [[Attack Mode/Attack Mode (Course)\|Attack Mode (Course)]] which states to NEVER fixate on anything and overthink about it, whenever the subject of overthinking comes to your mind, you should think about "Can I Fix it?" and "Can I learn from this to be better?" If yes, take the learnings and go home. If no, then it isn't worth your time.

This allows you to train your brain via [[Attack Mode/Neuroplasticity\|Neuroplasticity]] to forge new connections and habits and this will become learned behaviour.
