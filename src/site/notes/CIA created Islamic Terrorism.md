# CIA created Islamic Terrorism
> Exploring how Osama Bin Laden's creation was a part of the CIA plan to empower the ISI and themselves to create a leader of a crusade which is funded by their money and training and works at their behest, breaking the pincer surrounding Pakistan by the name of Afghanistan & India. 

CIA applied tactical lessons of [[The U.S-Vietnam War\|The U.S-Vietnam War]]; no dirty work by the CIA and no American casualties. The CIA looked for a Saudi figurehead to lead the crusade or jihad so that it can go International & appear respectable.

### Creation of Jihadi Terrorism & its Global Ambassador
A well-connected man to the Saudi Royals - Osama bin Laden was selected.
Osama was a wealthy engineer who supervised the construction of the Khost Tunnel Complex in 1986 which was an ammunation depot, a training centre and a medical facility for the Jihadis.

Around 80,000 Jihadis called as "Mujahedeen" were trained by Brigadier Yusuf of the ISI over the time period of 4 years. Select few were trained in American Facilities in Fort Brag, North Carolina and CIA's Camp Perry among other locations of Virginia.

A total of 43 countries took part in financing this "Jihad" of Global Terrorism and the Mujahedeen's natural outgrowth the Taliban was apparently called bad even when their aim is the same as before of having Afghanistan ran by the Muslim Sharia Law. 
I can prove the natural progression of the Mujahedeen into the Taliban since the words "Mujahed" and "Talib" both are synonyms which mean "Student" in English. It is just that the West used two different names for the same term to create a duality of Mujahedeen good, Taliban bad.

### Creation of The Golden Opium Crescent
Opium production was encouraged in Afghanistan by the ISI and its sources and that opium was sent in trucks to Pakistan's North West Frontier Province (NWFP) on the other side of the [[Durand Line\|Durand Line]] where the opium would be refined into heroin and then sent to Karachi for Global Shipment via trucks. 

The trucks on their return journey from Karachi to NWFP would carry weapons consignments sent by the CIA. If only Pakistan could use that kind of efficiency in driving their economy in an actually pious way, they would have been miles ahead of us.

The Dirty money of the Golden Crescent would be funneled through the rogue bank named [[Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI)\|Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI)]] which shut its offices in 1991 (soon after it served its purpose and the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR)\|Soviet Union]] had collapsed).

The same process was followed in the Myanmar & Thailand based and U.S-backed Kuomintang Forces later in the 1950s and this is the crescent that China revived.
