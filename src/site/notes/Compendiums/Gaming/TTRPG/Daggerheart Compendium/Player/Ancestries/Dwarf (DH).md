# Dwarf (DH)
> A [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Ancestries/DH Species Ancestry\|DH Species Ancestry]] of shorter humanoids (4-5 feet tall) with thick hair. Dwarves are famous for their culture of hard-working skilled craftsmen and craftswomen. They are notorious drinkers and dominate any tavern where there are Dwarven Settlements nearby.

Regardless of Gender, Dwarves have facial hair and tough skin & nails due to high amounts of Keratin. Regardless of their gender, all Dwarves have some level of Facial Hair which they decorate and are prideful in.

On choosing Dwarf, you get the following Ancestry Features: 
- ***Increased Fortitude***: Spend 3x [[Hope Token\|Hope Token]] to half the incoming damage.
- ***Thick Skin***: When taking Minor Damage, roll a 1d6. On a roll result of 5+, take 0 damage.

Lifespan of average dwarf: 250 years.

> [!tip] TIP: Leverage Common Fantasy Tropes (tastefully)
> Common Fantasy Trope is that Dwarves and [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Ancestries/Elf (DH)\|Elves]] do not like each other. When playing a dwarf, think of how it is only Logical that Elves are complete polar opposites of you. When playing Elf, consider how the Dwarves being covered in hair (even on the face) can be seen as unhygenic by Elves who barely grow facial hair, even for men!
> Do not go berserk against a fellow Elf though (player character or NPC) but you can include a curious question about Hair in the conversation somewhere.
