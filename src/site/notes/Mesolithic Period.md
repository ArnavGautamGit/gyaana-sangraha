# Mesolithic Period
> Period of Human History and the middle part of [[Stone Age\|Stone Age]] where proto-humans began expanding outside forests. 

This period lasted from 9000 BC to 7000 BC
This period marked amazing and rapid changes to the human race over a short time.
Humans began to reach mastery over stone tools. Many started using [[Obsidian (Rock)\|Obsidian]] to build sharper tools. Proto-Humans got smart enough & skilled enough to build special stone equipment like [[Microliths\|Microliths]] - which were stone tools in the size range of 1cm to 9cm in size used primarily to kill and cut smaller animals to use as bait for larger ones.

Mesolithic Period is also the time where proto-humans discovered one of the processes to light a fire and how to use fire to cook animal meat and make it last longer. It is also the time when humans started domesticating animals like wolves and birds.
