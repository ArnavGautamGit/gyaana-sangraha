# Dungeons & Dragons
> A [[Table-Top Role-Playing Game\|Table-Top Role-Playing Game]], originally made in the 20th century but has received many updates over the years. The Latest one (which this notes uses) is the 2024 update to the game's 5th Edition. 

A D&D game is really set around the players - the players make their characters and the DM (Dungeon Master) is the one that really crafts the story to life - the individual stories of all the players and also the overall story of the world.
