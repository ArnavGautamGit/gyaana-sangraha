# Atomic Number
> Defined as the total number of protons in the nucleus. 

Although, In practice for un-charged atoms, it does not matter whether protons are used or electrons are - since they are equal in number. 
In case the atom has a charge, protons are used as a standard since to get negatively charged, the atom accepts a free electron and to get positively charged, it ejects one of its own. In either case, for a charged atom the number of protons is unequal to the number of electrons. 

Since the number of electrons keep changing but the number of protons cannot change without [[Nuclear Fission\|fissioning]] the atom (where it is not even the same atom anymore) protons are used as the standard for measuring the Atomic Number.
