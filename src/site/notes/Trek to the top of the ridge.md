# Trek to the top of the ridge
The trek involved going to the top of the ridge where we wanted to recce if a path to the edge is possible and I told papa that it is. There is a wall atop the ridge to mark the ending of the government land of the [[FRH Nagthat\|FRH Nagthat]].

We inadvertantly found the way to [[Trek to the edge of the ridge\|Trek to the edge of the ridge]] fairly easily, sometime later.

Looking towards the river, Mussoorie is visible on the top of the second mountain ridge from the top of the Nāgthāt ridge.
