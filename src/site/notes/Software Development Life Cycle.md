# Software Development Life Cycle
> A concept that describes the life cycle of a piece of Software from its ideation all the way to its deployment and maintainance. If the software gets updated, then that aspect is included in the life cycle as well else not.

Seldom it is also referred to as ***Systems*** Development Life Cycle although SDLC is the short form for either of them. In Application Development, the term ***Application Development Life Cycle*** or ***ADLC*** is preferred.

The multiple stages of the Life Cycle is described as the following:
1. Feasablility Study Stage (also called Planning Stage)
2. Requirement Analysis (also called Defining Stage)
3. Software Design
4. Design Implementation (i.e., programming)
5. [[Software Testing\|Software Testing]]
6. Maintainance and Evolution

It is important to note there are models based on this life cycle which are explored in [[SDLC Models\|SDLC Models]].
