# Network Application Architecture
> Architectures used by Applications which are hosted on a server to operate in the [[Application Layer\|Application Layer]] of desired [[Computer Networks\|Computer Networks]].

There are three major types of Network Application Architectures on which an application is built:
1. [[Client-Server Architecture\|Client-Server Architecture]]
2. [[Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Architecture\|Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Architecture]]
3. Hybrid Architecture

It is important to note that Hybrid Architecture is a mixture of the above two and as a result, may have unique traits depending upon any particular application i.e., depending on what the app's functionality is: It may have varying mixture of how much of each style is used. 

Regardless, generally one of the best examples for the Hybrid Approach is: Instant Messaging Apps where clients talk to each other using the server and messages are end-to-end encrypted. Same goes with UPI apps and Bank-to-Bank Transfers.
