### Plot Summary

- First Map, they meet the Giants who tell them they are Lumber Jack, Bart, Barnes & Noble.
- Jack & Bart are siblings, Barnes and Noble are also siblings, but they are cousins.
- They live in Snowfield. The small riverlet is an irrigation channel, not the actual river.
- The Bridge was finished by yesterday evening, they went home as it was getting dark and they wouldn't be able to see shit in the dark.
- Storm last night caused a flash flood that wiped the bridge.
- The village of Riverside Pass was wiped in the flash flood. One of the survivors was a swordsmith connected to [[Sir Arthur I Nightingale\|Sir Arthur I Nightingale]] who now lives in Snowfield. Many are displaced to nearby villages.
- Bailiff (Radzig) gets busy in the rescue operation as the episode ends.
- Alternate: if the players had rolled with fear and I have the time, I can initiate a griphon attack!
