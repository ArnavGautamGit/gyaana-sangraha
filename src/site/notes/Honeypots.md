# Honeypots
> Security system that uses a visible, seemingly high-priority & high-value targets as open decoys with all major ports open to attract [[Black-Hat Hackers\|Malicious Hackers]] to try attacking or scanning the target.

Decoys are laced with powerful logging services that log each and every action taken on these honeypots and store them safely on the device. These logs are used to analyse which entries have malicious intents and block those IP addresses.

The Logs can also be used to identigy the type, technique and bandwidth (scope) of the attack. This is called "Attack TTB Profiling". Why is this helpful? To keep their firewalls updated and keep track of new types of [[Zero-Day Attacks\|Zero-Day Attacks]] that are possible.
