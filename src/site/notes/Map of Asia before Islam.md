# Map of Asia before Islam
![Map of Asia before Islam.png](/img/user/Vaulted%20Images/Map%20of%20Asia%20before%20Islam.png)
The Map shows Christianity in Blue - primarily practiced in areas like modern Papua New Guinea and European side of Russia. Across the alps on the eastern side of Russia is the part practising folk religions, the intermixing was hard due to the Alps separating the two sides I guess.

Parts of Africa are visible & coloured white due to no data availability it seems or the fact that it is debatable whether Ancient Egyptians (for example) would consider themselves Asians or Africans.

We see Japanese Areas are Red, since the Japanese Folk Religions were similar to HInduism and Buddhism. Please check the note: [[Similarities between Japanese Buddhism and Hinduism\|Similarities between Japanese Buddhism and Hinduism]]

Central Asia, China (along with areas it controlled) and Phillipines are Buddhist. Whereas modern India, Pakistan and most South East Asian nations along with parts of modern Iran and Afghanistan are Hindu Majority displayed in Saffron/Orange.

Majority of Iran practiced Zoroastrianism (Parsi Religion) whereas majority of the Arabian Peninsula followed the Arab Polytheism and Judaism.
