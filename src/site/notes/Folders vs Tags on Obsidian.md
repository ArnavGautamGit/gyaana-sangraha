# Folders vs Tags on Obsidian
> Heated debate whether I should organise my notes by tags or by folders.

Organising in folders means I have to limit the note to one topic (if the folders are used to depict each topic) unless the setup is that the folders do not correspond to topics such as being used to separate the new notes from old notes that will no longer connect with anything else because they are unrelated to 99% of things in the vault.

For example: Computer Science Notes can go into their own folder for ease of finding and studying while MOCs and Tags can also be used to further divide them into Subjects. Having separate Subject folders is stupid. 

Similarly, now with Bases released I do not need to organise my books into folders either.
I can use the tag: "book" signify that it is a book.
