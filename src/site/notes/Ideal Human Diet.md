# Ideal Human Diet
Since the Paleolithic ages, humans have been surviving on a diet which resulted in a Three Million Year Jump i.e., rapid growth and development of the brain from Homo Erectus to Homo Sapien species.

The Diet consisted of 40% Protein, 40% Carbohydrates and 20% Fats.
The Carbohysrates in this diet were simple carbohydrates coming from Fruits and Vegetables - not cereals and flour.

Before Homo Erectus species came to be, our diets were plant-based but the emergence of grasslands limited the incentive in walking for miles to eat 2-4 apples and forced the new Homo Erectus species to switch to meat-based diets because that was more energy-efficient.

Due to this, the small intestine in Homo Erectus species got shortened (since they are no longer as plant-based as before) and the same genetics passed on to Humans.

All the contemporary Humans who open to non-vegetarianism can easily switch to increasing meat and decreasing sugars & carbs to live a healthier lifestyle. Keep in mind to stay away from Red Meat like Pork and Beef and stick to stuff like Turkey and Chickens for lean sources of proteins.

### Sample Vegetarian Diet
The Diet lists a way to achieve the same diet as our bodies were designed for without breaking any religious codes or killing animals.

- The diet should have 40% Carbohydrates with the following split: 
	- 15% Grains 
		- Himalayan Buckweat (Kuttu/कुट्टु) over Wheat 
		- Quinoa over Rice
	- 15% Vegetables
	- 10% Fruits.
- The Diet then should add 40% Protein with the following split:
	- 15% Legumes
		- Red Kidney Beans (राजमा)
		- Beans
		- Peanuts
		- Chick Peas (छोले)
	- 10% Pulses
		- Dal (दाल)
		- Kabuli Chane
		- Black Chane
	- 15% Dairy + Other Sources
		- Milk (दूध)
		- Cottage Cheese (Paneer/पनीर)
		- Soya Chunks
		- Soyabeans
		- Tofu
- The next thing is 15-20% from Healthy Fats with preference for Unsaturated Fats. Remember to keep any Saturated Fat in check. Trans Fat is a big NO.
- The last is 0-5% margin for sugary treats and festive stuff. Maybe even cheat meals that you can eat once in a while.

Important Note: If you cannot fulfil Protein demands, you can add Whey Protein. Keep in mind that [[Selecting Quality Whey Protein\|Selecting Quality Whey Protein]] is very important.
