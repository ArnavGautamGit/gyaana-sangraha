# Goblin (DH)
> A [[DH Species Ancestry\|DH Species Ancestry]] of small humanoids with massive eyes and ears - so big that one or both of their ears can be folded over the face to cover it entirely. Most Goblins have ears that are as big as their head (if not marginally bigger). Average heights range from 3 to 4 feet.

Goblins often use ear positions to communicate non-verbally similar to how "Body Language" works. Due to their large eyes and ears, they tend to be able to see & hear from long distances away.

On taking Goblin, you get the following Ancestry Features:
- ***Danger Sense***: mark a [[Stress Point\|Stress Point]] to make an Adversary reroll their attack against you or any ally in Very Close Range.
- ***Surefooted***: You ignore disadvantage for Agility Rolls.

Average Lifespan for Goblins: 100 years
