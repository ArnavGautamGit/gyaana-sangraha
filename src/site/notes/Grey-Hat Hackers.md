# Grey-Hat Hackers
> One of the [[Various Types of Hackers\|Various Types of Hackers]] who are neither with the [[White-Hat Hackers\|White-Hat Hackers]] nor with the [[Black-Hat Hackers\|Black-Hat Hackers]], rather they are people who switch sides and favour only themselves. They are motivated by personal gain only.

Nothing much more is known about them since the spectrum between White and Black is too diverse.0
