# Gross Margin
> Defined as the total margin on manufacturing cost a business earns when selling a product. It is important to note that [[Sales & Marketing Costs\|Sales & Marketing Costs]] are not included here.

It is calculated by using the following formula:
$$\Large \text{Net Revenue} - \text{Cost of Goods Sold} = \text{Gross Margin}$$
This is further used to calculate the business's [[EBITDA\|EBITDA]] - which is one of the most important terms in business.
