# Ground Control System
> The System which is used to control an Unmanned System of any kind from the base of operations which was traditionally always at the ground level caused the nomenclature to be "Ground Control Station" since it required a massive room with multiple people.

Nowadays the entire system is even made in portable format & can be used from any remote location, sometimes even in the air. Hence, instead of "Station", scholards began using words such as "System" and due to [[Autopilot\|Autopilot]] becoming the norm and minimal commands required popularised the term "Command Control System" at least in Military Circles.

### UAV Ground Control
> Main Note: [[UAV Ground Control\|UAV Ground Control]]

Since computing power has grown substantially faster than the complexity of most UAVs, unless a UAS is meant for War and Bombing, most UAS do not have a fixed station and prefer portability.

At the same time, not any random remote controller, yoke or control system can be considered as a GCS.
It has to fulfill a few criteria.
1. UAV must have a POV camera which is used to pilot it.
	1. The Camera used for Piloting may or may not be the same used to capture photo or video from the UAV for recording purposes.
2. The GCS should have a live feed from the POV camera of a UAV and an ability to display the same on a screen.
3. The controller should have a range greater than a [[Wireless Area Network (WAN)\|Wireless Area Network (WAN)]] or Wi-Fi signal i.e., it must be complex enough and have a long enough range to warrant a camera.

### Rocket Ground Control
These Ground Control Systems are still not portable since the complexity of the rockets has also proportionally increased as the computing power of the systems.
Not to mention how multiple people are needed for keeping tabs on multiple parts, telemetry data, sensors collecting the data, communication between teams, communication with any onboard pilots etc.

Rocket Ground Control controls all parts of a rocket but in general interventions are not made until it is an absolute necessity or emergency

### Aircraft Ground Control
> Main Topic: [[Air Traffic Control\|Air Traffic Control]]

Regardless of Military or Civil Aviation, there are enough aircrafts in the air that aroud airports and even otherwise, we need specific air-routes that can be used to keep the traffic together and ordered instead of absolutely chaotic.

Air Traffic Control and [[Air Traffic Controllers\|Air Traffic Controllers]] often in Towers or other parts of an airport, direct the planes with directions for which direction to fly and safely land. Hence, avoiding loss of lives, aircrafts, pilots and finances.
