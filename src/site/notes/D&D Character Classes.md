# D&D Character Classes
> Each Player Character in D&D has a Class. There are many classes a player can choose from depending upon what books they've bought.

Since all Additional Books for the 2024 Revision of 5E are yet to release - there are a few Classes that have not released yet. When they do release and I have access to them, I will add a listing for them, until then I will list them with an empty note.

### List of Classes
- [[Artificer (D&D)\|Artificer]] - Yet to Release in "Forge of the Artificer", currently in Early Access by same name.
- [[Barbarian (D&D)\|Barbarian]]
- [[Bard (D&D)\|Bard]]
- [[Cleric (D&D)\|Cleric]]
- [[Druid (D&D)\|Druid]]
- [[Fighter (D&D)\|Fighter]]
- [[Monk (D&D)\|Monk]]
- [[Paladin (D&D)\|Paladin]]
- [[Ranger (D&D)\|Ranger]]
- [[Rogue (D&D)\|Rogue]]
- [[Sorcerer (D&D)\|Sorcerer]]
- [[Warlock (D&D)\|Warlock]]
- [[Wizard (D&D)\|Wizard]]
