# Throughput in Computer Networks
Definition:
> *"The Rate at which the sender is sending or the receiver is receiving packets."*
> ~ Page 73 of "Computer Networking: A Top Down Approach" by James F. Kurose et al.

Since the "rate at which a computer is sending/receiving packets" is known as transmission rate, we can also define it as:
> "The Minimum of Transmission Rates of all components across the Network"
> ~ derived definition


Throughput can be divided into two types:
1. ***Instantaneous Throughput*** ---> Calculated at that very instant
2. ***Average Throughput*** ---> Average of Instantaneous throughputs taken over a period of time
