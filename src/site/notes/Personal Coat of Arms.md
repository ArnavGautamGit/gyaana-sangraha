# Personal Coat of Arms
> A practice in [[Heraldry\|Heraldry]] where a person would depict themselves either with a [[Coat of Arms\|Coat of Arms]] or a [[Heraldic Achievement\|Heraldic Achievement]] for identification of participants in a case of war or any public tournaments.

It is important to note that I did NOT make this to intentionally fake or claim a nobel rank in a democratic republic like India or elsewhere. It is only made for the intention of creating a unique personal brand to be used in informal printables and/or informal digital works as complementary or supplementary to my name & identity. This will never be used in government works and I shall never use it to violate any law or guidelines set by the government of India or wherever I reside. 

### Design
I have avoided using any Helm on this Coat of Arms since the rules regarding them differ across traditions and are fairly dubious anyway. Neither have there been a use of supporters since they are usually granted after a great deed. One could disregard these rules but shall be seen as pretentious. The only contention I have heard online is the use of the letter Omega, since it is characterised as an alphabet & not a true charge or symbol of any kind. I tried using the Ouroboros in its place but it did not look as imposing.

### Blazon
> "*Gules, an omega majuscule Or, a chief of the second charged with a longsword sword, point to sinister, of the first*"

As seen in Historical Records, each Coat of Arms required a blazon which would be used as a descriptor of the design that needed to be painted on the shield of each soldier that does not carry a personal Coat of Arms. Even among those that do, it was common to use the state's Coat of Arms in cases of War if their own arms are not extensively famous.
