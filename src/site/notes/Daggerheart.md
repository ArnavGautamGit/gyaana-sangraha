# Daggerheart
> A [[Table-Top Role-Playing Game\|Table-Top Role-Playing Game]] made & backed by [[Critical Role\|Critical Role]]. It is releasing in Spring 2025 but it is already out in Open Beta in 2024.

It is similar to [[Dungeons & Dragons\|D&D]] but not the same. It uses 2d12 instead of 1d20. I am also planning to create my own [[DaggerSoul Project\|Daggerheart Bot]] named "DaggerSoul" but first I need a bot that can ping it all the time.

### Character Creation & Game Mechanics
In Daggerheart, a pair of d12 dice are used - known as the [[Duality Dice\|Duality Dice]].
The Character Creation Process is described in [[DH Character Creation\|DH Character Creation]].
If you want to Multi-class, check the [[DH Multiclassing Rules\|DH Multiclassing Rules]]
The Combat is decribed in [[DH Combat Rules\|DH Combat Rules]].
There are specific rules for Character Death in [[Daggerheart#Character Death\|DH Character Death Rules]].
There are also no shortage of mechanics for [[DH Character Rest Rules\|DH Character Rest Rules]].

Checking if an attack hits or not is checked via the 2d12 [[Duality Dice\|Duality Dice]] instead of the classic d20, there are other concepts like [[Hit Point Slots\|Hit Point Slots]] which are fixed for each character (unless increased by taking a specific Class or Foundation) while the characters can spend or mark off [[Armour Slots\|Armour Slots]] to avoid taking as much damage to their Hit Points and possibly dying. 

Advantage and Disadvantage is marked using a d6 dice along with the 2d12, if the player has an Advantage on a roll, add the d6 value. If the player has Disadvantage, subtract the d6 value.

1x [[Hope Token\|Hope Token]] can be spent by any character to give another character apart from themselves an advantage on their rolls. 
Whereas any pair of characters can choose to strike off 3x [[Hope Token\|Hope Token]] each to team up & attack together at the same time.

### Character Death Mechanics
There are a few option for their character Death Move a player can perform when their character marks their final [[Hit Point Slots\|HP Slot]] and they need to perform their final move. The Moves are listed below:
1. ***Death Leaves a Mark***: Avoid Death but permanently cross out one slot for [[Hope Token\|Hope Tokens]].
	1. On Demiplane, click on "Hope" in your character sheet to see Scars. Mark one scar.
	2. On Physical Character Sheet, use a permanent marker to cover the Hope Slot.
	3. Characters in Lower Levels do not get scars but important items may fall to the villain's side as the tide of battle shifts.
		1. Characters under Level 2 do not get scars.
		2. Level 3 Characters have to roll a d20 with DC of 11 to not get scarred.
2. ***The Dice have Spoken***: Roll the [[Duality Dice\|Duality Dice]] to see whether the character lives or passes.
	1. if the Dice roll higher with Hope, Character Lives.
	2. if the Dice roll higher with Fear, Character Dies.
3. ***Blaze of Glory***: The Dying Character can commit to one action that will be an instant Critical Success and even actions like killing one or multiple adversaries is allowed even if a Critical Success does not allow it.
