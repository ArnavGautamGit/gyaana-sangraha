# Wizard (D&D)
> Defined by their exhaustive study of Magic, these are the spellcasters that have shaped classic Fantasy Media as one of the most iconic characters - especially the likes of Gandalf from the Lord of the Rings (both [[Lord of the Rings (Books)\|Books]] and [[Lord of the Rings (Movie Trilogy)\|Movies]]).
> They cast spells of explosive fire, arcing lightning, subtle deception, and spectacular transformations. Their magic conjures monsters from other planes of existence, glimpses the future, or forms protective barriers. Their mightiest spells change one substance into another, call meteors from the sky, or open portals to other worlds. 
> Most Wizards share a scholarly approach to magic. 
> They examine the theoretical underpinnings of magic, particularly the categorization of spells into schools of magic. Renowned Wizards such as Bigby, Tasha, Mordenkainen, and Yolande have built on their studies to invent iconic spells now used across the multiverse. 
> The closest a Wizard is likely to come to an or dinary life is working as a sage or lecturer. Other Wizards sell their services as advisers, serve in mili tary forces, or pursue lives of crime or domination. But the lure of knowledge calls even the most unadventurous Wizards from the safety of their libraries and laboratories and into crumbling ru ins and lost cities. Most Wizards believe that their counterparts in ancient civilizations knew secrets of magic that have been lost to the ages, and discov ering those secrets could unlock the path to a power greater than any magic available in the present age.
