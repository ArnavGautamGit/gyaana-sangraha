# D&D Character Creation
> A note detailing the process and rules surrounding Character Creation in [[D&D Compendium/Dungeons & Dragons\|D&D]].

The steps to create a character is described in the following steps:
1. Select a Character Ancestry (Human, Elf, Celestial, Orc, Dwarf etc.)
2. Choose a Character Class (Fighter, Barbarian, Monk, Wizard etc.)
	1. You get special features (abilities) from your class
	2. You may gain proficiency in weapon or armour types
	3. Record all of this on Character Sheet
	4. ***==Character Ancestries & Classes are given in Chapter 2&3 for reference==***
3. Choose Level (Take Level 1 unless your [[Dungeon Master (DM)\|DM]] says otherwise)
4. Now, time to use any of the available options to take ability scores.
	1. You could use any system that your [[Dungeon Master (DM)\|Dungeon Master (DM)]] permits:
		1. Point-Buy System
		2. Standard Array
		3. Rolling the Dice
		4. or any other....
	2. Ability scores like Strength, Dexterity, Constitution etc. help you understand the limits of your character and are needed sometimes to unlock certain multiclasses.
	3. Ability Scores are boosted by your Ancestry! For example: Human Characters get +1 to all 6 ability scores according to page 12 of the [[D&D Compendium/D&D Player's Handbook\|D&D PHB (2014)]].
	4. Ability Scores also have Ability Modifiers (latter is used more often)
5. Then Choose Starting Equipment including weapons, armour and other gear. All items are in the Chapter 5 of the [[D&D Compendium/D&D Player's Handbook\|PHB (2014)]].
6. Now we calculate the character's AC. Many online programs do it automatically, but the formula for it is: $$AC = formula$$
7. If your character does not use a shield or wear armour, you get a AC = 10 + their Dexterity Modifier.
8. Attacks with Melee Weapons use Strength, attacks with ranged weapons use Dexterity unless they are thrown melees like handaxes.


### Tiers of Play
Now in Finality, we must look at the Tiers in D&D. 
Tier 1 is from Level 1 to 4
Tier 2 is from Level 5 to 10
Tier 3 is from Level 11 to 16
Tier 4 is from Level 17 to 20.

There are tiers beyond 20 on certain tables that are known by a variety of names such as "Paragon" or "Tier 5".
