# Cliffhanger
> In Literature & Storytelling, an ending without a [[Resolution\|Resolution]] or a story without an ending is known as a Cliffhanger ending

Cliffhangers are often utilised in modern endings since there is a way of making sequels hyped, needed and preferred - giving the chance to the film makers making more movies in the same setting & characters.
### Nomenclature
One of the reasons it is named such could be that since the "slope" of the ending is not gentle and rather abrupt it is like a cliff touching the ocean instead of a beach.

Another reason could be that on the graph,the story does not end on the same flat way on the x-axis, rather hangs somewhere above.
