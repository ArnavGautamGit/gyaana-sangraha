# Druid (DH)
> A [[Compendiums/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/DH Character Creation#Character Class\|Character Class]] of a forst-dwelling and nature-loving, shape-shifters who can take the form of a beast & gain any temporary [[Compendiums/Daggerheart Compendium/General/Hit Point Slots\|Hit Point Slots]] if specific rules such as [[Compendiums/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Classes/Druid (DH)#Druid's Hope - Special Ability\|Druid's Hope]] are leveraged.

Druids in [[Compendiums/Daggerheart Compendium/Daggerheart\|Daggerheart]], live in small closed settlements and are oblivious to the details of how society at large works. For reference, take [[Critical Role\|Critical Role]] Campaign 3's druid character played by Ashley.

***GM's Tip***: Optimise your character around the [[Instinct\|Instinct]] Trait.

### Domains
Domains of a Class  decide the domain cards (and abilities) one gets to pick up.
Each class has 2 fixed Domains.
The Druid's domains are: [[Sage\|Sage]] and [[Arcana\|Arcana]].

### Base Scores
Base [[Compendiums/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Evasion Score\|Evasion Score]]: 10
Base [[Compendiums/Daggerheart Compendium/General/Hit Point Slots\|Hit Point Slots]]: 6

### Class Items
Each Class also has a specific item they can choose to have - and they will become plot points in the story. They must have one of two.
For a Druid, choose between EITHER a *Small Bag of Rocks & Bones* OR a *Strange Pendant Found in the Dirt*.

### Druid's Hope - Special Ability
***Evolution***: Druids can use these 3x [[Hope Token\|Hope Token]] to enter Beastform *without* marking 1x [[Compendiums/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Stress Point\|Stress Point]]

### Class Features - Wildtouch & Beastform
The Druid is one of the few classes in Daggerheeart which have more than one Class Feature. The two class features being: Wildtouch and Beastform.
- ***Wildtouch***: Perform a harmless, subtle effects that involve nature such as making a flower grow or bloom instantly or starting a campfire whenever you want.
- ***Beastform***: Mark 1x [[Compendiums/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Stress Point\|Stress Point]] to into magical creature of your choice from the Beastform list (Homebrew allowed on [[Game Master (GM)\|GM]]'s prior approval). 
	- The Druid may (at any time) drop out of the Beastform.
	- The Druid cannot use Domain Cards to cast spells, other abilities can be used. Spells casted before transformation into Beastform remain active till their stipulated time.
	- This form still allows the Druid to freely mark [[Compendiums/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Armour Slots\|Armour Slots]] & the form is immediately dropped on the last [[Compendiums/Daggerheart Compendium/General/Hit Point Slots\|HP Slot]] marked or when the player takes Major Damage in any beastform which has the "fragile" feature.

### Background Questions
These help the players think about their character deeper or get a few points of thought to nudge them in the direction to aid character building. Choosing to answer these questions are completely optional:
- Why was the community you grew up in so reliant on nature and its creatures?
- Who was the first wild animal you bonded with? Why did your bond end?
- Who has been trying to hunt you down? What do they want from you?

### Connections
These help you in case your party wants to have a premade set of connections between the party i.e, if you want the party to know each other before the campaign begins. Choosing to answer these questions is completely optional:
- What did you confide in me that makes me leap into danger for you every time?
- What animal do I say you remind me of?
- What affectionate nickname have you given me?

# Footnotes
- Beastform has specific restrictions into which animals a druid can transform into, they're here
	- ***Creature Category***: Each category’s name describes the common role or behavior of creatures in that category (such as Agile Scout). This name is followed by a few examples of animals that fit in that category (in this example, fox, mouse, and weasel).
	- ***Character Trait***: While transformed, you gain a bonus to the listed trait. For example, while transformed into an Agile Scout, you gain a +1 bonus to your Agility. When this form drops, you lose this bonus.
	- ***Attack Rolls***: When you make an attack while transformed, you use the creature’s listed range, trait, and damage dice, but you use your Proficiency. For example, as an Agile Scout, you can attack a target within Melee range using your Agility. On a success, you deal d4 physical damage using your Proficiency.
	- ***Evasion***: While transformed, you add the creature’s Evasion bonus to your normal [[Compendiums/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Evasion Score\|Evasion]]. For example, if your Evasion is usually 8 and your Beastform says “Evasion +2,” your Evasion becomes 10 while you’re in that form.
	- ***Advantages***: Your form makes you especially suited to certain actions. When you make an action or reaction roll related to one of the verbs listed for that creature category, you gain advantage on that roll. For example, an Agile Scout gains advantage on rolls made to sneak around, search for objects or creatures, and related activities.
	- ***Features***: Each form includes unique features. For example, an Agile Scout excels at silent, dextrous movement—but they’re also fragile, making you more likely to drop out of Beastform.
