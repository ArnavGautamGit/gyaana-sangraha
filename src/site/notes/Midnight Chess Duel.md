# Midnight Chess Duel
Abhishek Uncle, my father's business partner had cordially invited us and our family to a destination wedding of his younger sister Anamika in the outskirts of Rishikesh. Now since my Fufa ji is also in the business as a partner, it was obvious that his family was also cordially invited.

I and Shaanu Bhaiya were roommates in the hotel since Apoorva had not really showed up.
In the night of the wedding, we couldn't really have the energy to keep awake for the night and actually be at the final few ceremonies (Phere, Sindur, Mangalsutra etc.).

I and Shaanu Bhaiya then had an idea to play Chess, so we played a few matches.
I asked Shaanu Bhaiya to send me an invite on Chess.com app after I finish downloading the app. In the meantime, he was watching YouTube Shorts for a while.

When I downloaded, I asked him for his phone so I could input my cringy username (Jedi_Arnav) & just play Chess with him. His Username was somehow even more cringy (addydaddy6969) but I am not gonna judge, maybe he was young when he made that or he was drunk... idk.

### Rapid Chess (10 min)
The default setting for invites on Chess.com is 10 min Rapid chess since that is the default game mode. It was not easy for me since I am more used to 3|2 Blitz chess (3 minute with 2 second time increment per move played). 
Needless to say he won the first match. Although there was a chance I could have won on time, Chess.com (being American) would call it a draw according to [[United States Chess Federation (USCF)\|United States Chess Federation (USCF)]] rules.

The Second Match did not go much different...

### Blitz Chess (3|2)
This was when I mentioned I am more used to shorter time constraints and if he would like to play 3|2 Blitz? Shaanu Bhaiya was willing to try out new things so he said yes. "What could go wrong?" he must be thinking after winning 2 Rapid Matches.

Throughout the following 6 Blitz chess matches, I won 5 and lost 1. 
The archived matches from this point onwards will not have any comments unless one fine day I sit back and analyse these games again. The board orientation shows which side I am playing in these matches like the previous matches.

I remember Shaanu bhaiya comment in one of these Blitz matches on my playstyle calling it fast-paced and aggressive (as in putting the other player in a time crunch). I really appreciated his kind words.

Here both of us were commenting "Intense!" and were already feeling the mental burn of playing chess in the middle of the night when you're already tired of a full day of festivities.

In this match below, when I played as Black, I missed a mate in one but he also played pretty well. Anyway, I should probably put my thumbs aside when analysing the board next time lol.

In this match below, I had my revenge!

The last match of the night before we went asleep because this especially was almost just as long (in terms of moves) as the rapid matches but each move came much faster. By the end of this match we were fricking drained.

### Conclusion
Keeping the scores of 0-2 and 5-1 in Blitz and Rapid chess respectively aside, it is important to note that both of us have different strengths. He sees each move as a new chess puzzle independent of the previous one whereas I understand chess holistically. i.e., he is more prone to re-thinking his options if something out of the ordinary is played. I have 2 moves & will play one of the two regardless of what is played by my opponent.

3|2 Blitz is too less time for him while 10 min Rapid Chess is too long for my patience level & I tend to make mistakes. I will suggest 5 min Blitz or 5|2 Blitz next time.
