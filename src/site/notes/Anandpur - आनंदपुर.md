# Anandpur - आनंदपुर
Vadnagar, which is now known as Modi's previous constituency (when he used to be the Gujarat CM) and also his home city, where at the railway station he used to sell tea! 

The town however - has a history of minimum 2200 years. A big chunk of history of the town cannot be uncovered since it is a living, breathing, city! 

Every square feet of the town is covered with SOME infrastructure - roads and houses decorate every inch of land available on a human made plateau. If you somehow find someplace to dig inside the town... (hypothetically) then it is nigh impossible to go deep enough to look beyond a certain time due to the town being just 14 kilometers (or approx. 8.6 miles) away from the Sabarmati river which drains in the sea, hence the ground being unstable and water seeping up the digsite making it way harder to preserve findings while also making it very unstable, the entire digsite could collapse if too much water seeps up, the collapse will not just bury the Archaeologists, it would also bury the history, destroy evidence and basically make it harder to dig ANYWHERE as further digging will create a domino effect and put the population of the city itself in danger by loosening the ground on which the modern city rests. 


The town's mentioned in the epic of Mahābhārata as आनर्तपुर (Anartapur) in the region of आनर्त (or Anarta) also called as आनर्तक्षेत्रः (or Anarta Kshetra - meaning Region of Anarta) it was the region of Northen Gujarat around the City of Vadnagar... did the region get the name from the city or the other way around?

## List of Excavations
The first important excavation in Vadnagar was done by the Maharaja Sayajirao University. Their trail was the Indo-Roman trade - with Red Pottery seen along with the Conch shell bangle industry! Keep in mind, Conch shell was considered sacred in India since it was a symbol of Lord Vishnu.
We discovered Coins, Iron, Terracotta as well...
The most interesting of all was the Terracotta tablets - that suggest that there was a Buddhist settlement here - in Vadnagar. This prompted more excavation.

Quoting the book "Excavations at Vadnagar" by B. Subba Rao and R.N Mehta.
Reprinted from "*The Journal of Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda*" Vol. IV No.1 March 1995.

> "The most authentic account is provided by [[Hiuen Tsang\|Hiuen Tsang]] who visited this place. Vadnagar in Kheralu Taluka and Mehsana District of Bombay State was known by many names Anandapur, Anartapur, Chamatkarpur and Vriddhanagar."

This excavation was carried out in Gavtaal, an even smaller town in the outskirts of the Eternal City. The excavation was haulted due to the team not being able to find any ways of digging in the middle of a nearly-overflowing settlement.

The excavation restarted nearly 40 years later! In 1992, when while ploughing his land, a farmer found a Bodhisattva idol about a kilometer if not closer to the main city! (roughly half-a-mile) in Malavadi Talav (Malavadi Pond)

This idol was made in Mathura Style - many such idols are available for viewing in the National Museum, New Delhi. It was 41 to 42 centimeters at the base and 51.3 centimeters tall.
After it was transcribed, it translated to:
> "सम्मतिय भिकुनो यो देवो बोधिसत्त्व तयो चेते अचार्येन महासयकेन परियह"

In English, it would be:
>"Acharya Mahaseyak brought the Bodhisattva, God of Sammatiya, for the Chaitya"

It is possibly the earliest statue of Buddhism found in this part of the World.

This confirmed [[Hiuen Tsang\|Hiuen Tsang]]'s statement that there were Buddhist Monastries here.
He was a Buddhist Traveller from China. He came to to India to visit multiple Buddhist sites in 7th century. 

Anandpur was a big part of his journey.
"Onantopulo" was how he pronounced the name.
He said there were 10 monastries, less than 1000 monks here.
He also called it the centre of Buddhism in present-day Northern Gujarat.
Excavations in areas around the field came to no avail.

## The Findings in Anandpur/Vadnagar
From 2006-2012 the Gujarat State Archaeology Department and then from 2014-2021 the Archaeological Survey of India did the digging...
They carried out MASSIVE excavations on the outskirts of the cities.
The deeper they dug, the more they uncovered! 

Even after all these excavations, they were still not able to find the beginnings of civilisation here since the town's history goes deeper than the depth of the water table here. You hit water before you hit beginning of civilisation.

The 2200 years of History of Vadnagar (then Anandpur) is divided into 7 periods of time. Also known as the Seven Cultural Periods.

1. [[Anandpur in pre-2nd Century BCE\|Anandpur in pre-2nd Century BCE]]
