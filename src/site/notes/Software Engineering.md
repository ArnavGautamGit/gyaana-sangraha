# What is Software Engineering?
> A Subject from my 6th Semester of my B.Tech Computer Science Degree from Jaypee Institute of Information Technology, Noida which teaches us all about how Softwares are made & the process behind it.

The Subject was taught to us by Ashish Sir who is famous for putting his heart and soul into teaching but for whatever reason he does not like latecomers who are made to stand up on the corner of the classroom. Due to 128 campus being far away from the Official hostels, some students do get light-headed and occassionally faint.
