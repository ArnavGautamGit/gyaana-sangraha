# Spyware
It can most simply be defined as:
> Software built or made for targeted espionage on a set target(s). It must be able to collect data points on the target machine & store/send them.

Although all Spywares are Active Trackers.
Spyware are further classified into two kinds - active and passive.

Passive Spyware indulge in eavesdropping and listening to all data being created on or passing through the target. Passive Spyware generally do not connect to the internet to send files directly.
Example: Offline [[Keyloggers\|Keyloggers]] that capture and save keystrokes.

Active Spyware indulges in active espionage involving sending raw or analysed form of captured data. It may also try to impersonate the target and contact others to capture more information or to spread further.
Example: [[Pegasus Spy System\|Pegasus Spy System]]
