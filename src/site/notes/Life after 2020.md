# Life after 2020
> A note on tracking my feelings about the world, life and society after the Chinese gift to humanity - the 2020 COVID-19 Pandemic.

I had just given my annual exams for 11th grade and was awaiting results when the pandemic occured. After the result came in and I had passed (obviously) I spent the entirety of 2020 and the 2021 second wave at home studying online - first in school and then in tuitions.

Life since then has been stupid. I felt that the spark in life was missing as if I had been taken off a dopamine high of watching movies all day, staying at home and having fun as we all treated school exams like group projects but I now realise in 2025 during a time when I am sitting alone at home unemployed - stuck in life - while others have started to move on with life as in getting jobs and stuff.

## Reasons for Missing Spark post-pandemic
Firstly, there is the loss of genuine family-owned and small-sized businesses that have lost so much money that it proved fatal from them. People had to sell the land on which their restaurants rested and now if you go to some other city it has the same old resto-chains like McDonalds and Burger King everywhere.

It was only China that added to its economy while other economies took a hit - there is a good coorelation to why China would want to release such a virus as a bioweapon. But I digress.

Secondly, whenever the economy of a country is in peril, Wars are imminent - especially when many countries are doing badly simultaneously while there is a rise of new powers - that conflict between the old and the new is the perfect recipe for more wars. Historically we saw that being the grounds for [[The First World War (WW1)\|WW1 (1914-1918)]] and [[The Second World War (WW2)\|WW2 (1939-1945)]] and in the modern age we have had wars like Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Israel being attacked by Hamas on October 7th trigerring the resurgence of the age old Israel-Palestine conflict/war. As we all know we also had India's Operation Sindoor when we slapped Pakistan aside. We saw the [[Bangladeshi Regime Change (2024)\|Bangladeshi Regime Change (2024)]].

Perspective of Time has been shaken for a lot of people - on the internet we often see people that complain that weeks feel like months while months feel like years (or that time seems to go slower in general) due to monotonous lives - AI has began to replace freshers and there are fewer people doing more work while economy has always been shit since 2020. Wars, regime changes and AI are only driving up the inflation - housing is unaffordable both in India, China and the USA or any major economy in today's world.

Not a fun place to be in. Not a fun thing to do.
2020s are the worst decade. 2000s and 2010s were best - even for music, movies and many other general spice of life things like cost of living and lower pollution among other things.
