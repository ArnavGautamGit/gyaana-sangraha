# Heraldic Achievement
> The unique design & colour combinations used as identifiers in Medieval Europe & records of these were maintained using the practice of [[Heraldry\|Heraldry]]. 

These designs adorned the capes, armours, shields and even for their cavalry!
It was needed since both enemies and friendlies were completely covered from head to toe in similar looking metallic armour made from similar materials (i.e., Steel). This could have led to [[Friendly Fire\|Friendly Fire]], although despite this being one of the more logical theories, it is still contested today.

The basic structure is given on the [Wikipedia Page on Heraldry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heraldry#Heraldic_achievement) and anyone who would like to learn of its details may go there.

### Accepted Misnomer - Coat of Arms
The term "Coat of Arms" is often also used but it is a misnomer due to how shields were losing prominence due to armour technology getting better and hence knights began wearing their heraldic achievements on their surcoats & the term of "coat of arms" was born. Although before that, the Royal Heralds were also wearing tabards & surcoats with the Royal Arms displayed on them (without the helm, crest etc.)

Nowadays, this term is used to describe the [[Escutcheon\|Escutcheon]] - the part of a Heraldic Achievement that includes only the design that goes onto the shield to be used by said knight.

### The Family Crest Misnomer
While certain heraldic traditions like the [[Eastern European Heraldic Traditions\|Eastern European Heraldic Traditions]] allow for an entire family to be represented by a single Heraldic Achievement may or may not be used with [[Cadency\|Cadency]] but the notion that the entire Achievement is a crest is factually inaccurate.

> [!tip] IMPORTANT: Heraldry is ***PERSONAL***
> Even if it says in the local rules or regulations that the coat of arms can be used to represent anyone of the family, it does not mean people who carry my surname can really use my coat of arms. They would have to prove that they are my CLOSEST DIRECT DESCENDENT born from a LINE of firstborns. My eldest child and then their eldest child and so on until it reaches them.
> 
> In most of eastern Europe, princes used the same heraldry as their fathers but with either a small design change or with [[Marks of Cadency\|Marks of Cadency]] to differentiate the heraldic achievements of the children from the father and among themselves on the basis of order of birth.

The Crest is the part of the Heraldic Achievement which people use on top of their helm in the design of the complete achievement, it is outside the [[Escutcheon\|Escutcheon]]. 

The reason may believe it came to be a misnomer is that older houses have many knights marrying many dames and the arms get further and further quartered. This meant that the design was now a mess. 
However the crest on their armorial achievement that the knight even wore/fixed on the top of their helmets in sporting events like [[Jousting\|Jousting]] remained the same - and THAT became the most memorable part of their identity.
