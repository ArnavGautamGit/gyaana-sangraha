# Incentive Super-Response Theory
> People respond to incentives by doing what is best for them and not what the grander intention behind an incentive is.

Incentive Systems have to be designed to be effective and exploitation-proof else people will use this theory to exploit the designers and planners of the incentive systems. 

The Author mentions that one of the best example of good incentive systems is (according to his claim) how in [[Ancient Rome & the Roman Empire\|Ancient Rome]], bridge designers and constructors were made to stand under the bridge during the bridge's opening ceremony while bad incentive systems are those like the ones used by the French in Vietnam to catch the Rats and submit their tails as proof for the reward/incentive.

The Author uses this theory to argue that [[Hourly Pay encourages Inefficiency\|Hourly Pay encourages Inefficiency]] is wrong and promotes quoting or using more hours to do the same work because it priotises the amount of time put in by the employee and not the quality or efficiency of work.
