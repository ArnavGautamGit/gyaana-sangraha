# Sangam Era & Literature
> An era in [[Indian History\|Indian History]] which began almost parallely to [[Indian Vedic Period\|Vedic Period]] and [[Indus Valley Civilsation\|IVC period]] which comprised of the three southernmost dynasties ruling over peninsular tip of India.  

At different points in time the three dynasties have controlled & lost control of the islands that are now [[Sri Lanka\|Sri Lanka]] but were called "Lanka" and "Ceylon" in different periods of history.

The three Sangam Era dynasties are [[Chola Dynasty\|Chola Dynasty]], [[Pandya Dynasty\|Pandya Dynasty]] and [[Chera Dynasty\|Chera Dynasty]] - all three of them have never been captured or destroyed completely except the one period in medieval history during [[Imperial Chola Dynasty\|Imperial Chola Dynasty]] where the other two dynasties survived but did not hold control over any location & resurfaced once the Cholas declined.

### Trade Relations with Romans
All three dynasties formed trade relations with the [[Ancient Rome & the Roman Empire\|Ancient Rome & the Roman Empire]].
They traded for Cotton, Spices, Ivories, Pearls in exchange for [[Roman Booleans (Gold Coins)\|Roman Booleans (Gold Coins)]].

Some Greek & Roman sources have mentioned how India (particularly these Sangam dynasties) have become a sink for [[Roman Booleans (Gold Coins)\|Roman Booleans]]. (particularly [[Pliny The Elder\|Pliny The Elder]]'s book named [[Natural History (book)\|Natural History]])

Roman books like [[The periphs of the Erythrean Sea\|The periphs of the Erythrean Sea]] (with an unknown author) mention ports of the Pandyas, Cholas and Cheras were mentioned as [[Kolkai Port\|Kolkai]], [[Puhar Port\|Puhar]] and [[Murisis Port\|Murisis]] respectively.

### Sangam Literary Conferences
There are three main Sangam Conferences, the first one is attended only by the Gods and no texts survive or meet public eye due to divine reasons (Gods being angry/secretive I guess).

In the Second Sangam Conference, Gods and royal families of the three dynasties meet with royal poets in toe. Only some of the texts survive.

In the Third Sangam Conference, only the royal families and poets meet & all the texts survive (very suspicious but okay) These texts mention many Tamil Gods, many members of the three royal families such as [[Nedunjeliyan\|Nedunjeliyan]] from the [[Pandya Dynasty\|Pandyas]] along with the [[Chola Dynasty\|Chola]] conqueror of Northern [[Sri Lanka\|Sri Lanka]] named [[Elara Chola\|Elara Chola]] and [[Karaikal Chola\|Karaikal Chola]] who created the [[Puhar Port\|Puhar Port]]. Among the [[Chera Dynasty\|Chera Dynasty]], the Sangam texts mention [[Senguthivan Chera\|Senguthivan Chera]] (also known as "Red Chera" or "Good Chera")

### Secret to Survival - Diplomatic Mastery
These three dynasties survived all the way into the medieval age, despite many great conquerors like [[Mauryan Empire\|Mauryan Empire]], [[Sātavāhana Empire\|Sātavāhana Empire]], [[Khilji Dynasty\|Khilji Dynasty]] and many more yet they were never conquered even into the [[Mughal Empire\|Mughal Empire]]'s age. That is because they were masters of Diplomacy & specifically Daughter Diplomacy where they would marry off their daughters to the major conqueror they are threatened by.
