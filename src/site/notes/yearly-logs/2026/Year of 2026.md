# Year of 2026
> Detailed yearly view template derived from Shwetabh Gangwar's [[Independent Courses/Attack Mode/Attack Mode (Course)\|Attack Mode (Course)]] where a smaller course called "Nuclear Mode" was included. 

The Template details the Monthly and Daily Views of the Year of 2026.
The template can be customised and uses a Community Plugin named "Dataview".
Please see the note on [[yearly-logs/2025/Year of 2025\|Year of 2025]] to see how to use the template

## Yearly Reflections
In the start of the year in January itself, I made a new change of adding a new section named "Daily Objectives" in the [[Vault Templates/daily-habit-log\|daily-habit-log]] template so that I can further give weightage to particular tasks over others which are a priority.

Also, in January, I gave two interviews - one in JS and another in BEL so that I could easily get a good apprenticeship/internship/job that could bring my career back on track. I have figured out some gaps in my knowledge and have been preparing to cover them. I have completely ditched Habitica & have permanently moved over to [[Task Management.base]] file inside Obsidian itself to manage all my tasks.

Also in January, I was able to find another arnav on Signal when i realised that the usernames "arnav.01" and "arnav.02" were not available (due to being taken). I messaged both of them individually and "arnav.01" managed to reply & we became friends. 
For the record, I am "arnav.03" on signal and everyone needs to have a two-digit number for their username as a suffix separated from the string by a fullstop.
