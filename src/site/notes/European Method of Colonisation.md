# How the White European Colonised others cultures

The process of destroying culture is somewhat like this:
1. To destroy culture you have to expose faultlines in it.
2. To expose faultlines, you have to create fake narratives & fake racial theories to create tension be it [[Aryan-Dravidian Divide\|Aryan-Dravidian Divide]] in India or [[Anti-Black Racial Theories\|Anti-Black Racial Theories]] in the Americas & Africa in the name of Anthropology & "Racial Studies/Science". We know that [["Early Anthropologists were the biggest Racists": Niel DeGrasse Tyson\|"Early Anthropologists were the biggest Racists": Niel DeGrasse Tyson]] Even Quijano was of the view that race was central to European Coloniality. 
3. For earlier cultures that he European ones, which obviously were older than paper and print, The Coloniser denied their culture and histories using the excuse that nothing is "written" anywhere. For cultures where written material was found, it was termed "myths". European Culture was made the benchmark - whichever culture operated differently were not considered cultures at all.
4. Colonial Structures were made to woo the elites - local education systems (if they exist) were destroyed, the people who became rich iinvited their families to their new homes and the money, wealth & lavish living wooed more elites.
5. Education System was of the coloniser was designed to reject the indigenous viewpoint and made a place where the native history & culture would be denied again - in short the young kids of the elites were shown the dreams of a lavish life with servants - most of the servants would be people and kids of the less-than-elite classes. Hence the elitew kids would start quitting their native culture en masse in favour of Europeanness.
6. The less-than elite would follow suit and for those who still won't follow, the structures of their native culture would be destroyed. 

Although expansionist mindsets did exist in Europe such as [[Alexander The Great\|Alexander The Great]] but they were not brutal or barbaric - neither were they deniers of other faiths or cultures. Infact they did not fear/attack other cultures. We know since there were Greek Soldiers who stayed at the border of Alexander's Empire and the Nanda Empire and started mixing Indic Religious practicies in their own (known as [[Indo-Greeks\|Indo-Greeks]] by various Historians) later turned to Buddhism and became known as [[Indo-Greek Buddhists\|Indo-Greek Buddhists]].

We also know that sometime later the Christian Victory over the Saxons would lead to the [[Christian destruction of Irminsul\|Christian destruction of Irminsul]] in the 770s... we see that something changed in the European mentality in the timeline - the change brought in by the advent of Christianity.

Also see the [[Racism is rooted in Christianity\|Racism is rooted in Christianity]] to see how racism is entrenched in Christianity and there is no thought that dates before Christianity which is this racist.

As established above, we have seen how race was central to colonisation & how the roots of racism lay in Christianity, it will not be wrong to say that the root of colonialism and coloniality (along with colonialist thought) is Christianity which aims to "save" the world by converting everyone to Christianity.
