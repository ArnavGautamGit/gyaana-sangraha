# Spy Games in India
The [[Mitrokhin Archive\|Mitrokhin Archive]] mentions India multiple times in its second volume. Although I have already mentioned in [[Mitrokhin Archive#Popular Criticisms of the Archive\|section on its criticisms]], it is important to note that this volume was written after Mitrokhin's death - so we cannot trust the claims that easily (not that we should trust the first one blindly either).

[[Vikram Sood\|Vikram Sood]], the former Secretary of [[R&AW\|R&AW]], states the following:
> "The Soviets wanted to keep us with them while the Americans wanted the Soviets out."
> "A major effort of the KGB was to discredit the CIA and spread stories about the 'CIA Hand' in India"

He also mentions that Soviets indirectly may have helped Sadashiv Kanoji Patil (Congress Leader) to lose the 1967 elections by insinuating that Patil was linked with the Pakistanis & received funds from Americans - it is unclear how much this forged letter played a role in the result but it seemed to have swayed some at the time.

It is well known how [[Morarji Desai\|Morarji Desai]] was the worst Indian PM but we do not know whether it is true that he received $20,000 per year from the CIA for being the biggest CIA informer during the [[3rd India-Pakistan War (1971)\|3rd India-Pakistan War (1971)]] as claimed by the investigative journalist & geopolitics expert [[Seymour Hersh\|Seymour Hersh]] in his book "[[The Prince of Power: Kissinger in the Nixon White House\|The Prince of Power: Kissinger in the Nixon White House]]".

Infact, Thomas Powers in his book - "[[The Man Who Kept the Secrets\|The Man Who Kept the Secrets]]" cited CIA Director Richard Helms when he claims there were more mysterious high-level sources during the [[3rd India-Pakistan War (1971)\|3rd India-Pakistan War (1971)]]. He claims that the source kept reporting after this since 'he' did not know that 'he' had been compromised. It is also said that the Americans were successful at running a very professional psychological campaign in India.

While the Americans tried to claim they had no influence in India but Soviets did & the Soviets were busy blaming Americans... the French Spy Ring was operating freely in the [[Coomar Narain Case (1985)\|Coomar Narain Case (1985)]] and the main accused of the [[Larkin Brothers Case (1980s)\|Larkin Brothers Case (1980s)]] were CIA assets.
