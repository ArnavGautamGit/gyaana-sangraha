# Quest of Polymathy
> A personal quest of becoming a Polymath.

As you may have guessed looking at my previous notes such as:
[[Four Hobbies of a Renaissance Man\|Four Hobbies of a Renaissance Man]]
[[Journey to Discover My Personal Ikigai\|Journey to Discover My Personal Ikigai]]
among any others

I want to become a Polymath and I have figured out that I can only be one if I plan out my hobbies into seasons - if I am interested in a particular hobby at a particular time, we engage into it and work at it before we get bored. When we get bored by one, we swap it for another.

### Skill Matrix
Skills, Areas of Interest, their competance among other things like side-gig potential.
Connected skills can be pitched as a package & can help heavily.

| Area                          | Competence    | Interest   | Confidence | Notes                                                                                                                                                  |
| ----------------------------- | ------------- | ---------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Computer Science              | Medium-High   | Low-Medium | Medium     | If given prep time, I can do great. I will use this area for earnig my primary source of income                                                        |
| Writing/Authorship            | High          | High       | High       | Could be an eventual secondary source of income.                                                                                                       |
| TTRPGs and Professional-GMing | Unknown       | High       | High       | I am yet to host an entire campaign as of now but I have a potential place to become a paid GM. ***==A Great side-gig if monetised==***                |
| Sketching & Art               | High (Gifted) | Medium     | Low-Medium | It has been a long time since I worked on any art piece. I erase often. ***==Latent Gift that requires brush-up==***.                                  |
| Voice Acting                  | Medium        | High       | High       | I have run a podcast, where I was praised. I have been praised for my vocal ability a lot.<br>***==A Good Side-gig if monetised==***                   |
| History & Philosophy          | Low-Medium    | High       | Medium     | Studying the subject for personal interest. Primarily interested in Indian sphere first.                                                               |
| Chess                         | Low           | High       | Medium     | I can at least become a 1800+ chess player if I start in 2025, I won't be titled ever.                                                                 |
| Martial Arts                  | Medium        | Medium     | Medium     | I have an Orange Belt in Karate. I have forgotten my Kata but I have retained my knowledge on technique. ***==Latent skill that needs refinement==***. |

### Internal Connectivity
I could leverage some skills as a package. For Example. I should be able to take my CompSci Skill and apply them to work on my job. Then for my side gigs, have various skills that complement each other & boost each other.

Example: I can practice Voice Acting in my time playing TTRPGs. I can also sketch out any NPCs using Reference Images to use with my campaign. I can use my interests in TTRPGs and Critical Role to give unique personalities to each character. I could use all three as separate gigs and all three together to write great books by converting the best timeline from my TTRPG campaigns to books! General writing techniques also get better.

### Weekly Hobby Split
1. TTRPG Session - Weekends (regardless of paid or free)
2. Writing - Preping TTRPG Sessions in weekdays
3. Sketching - 15 minutes on Tuesday, Thursday & Saturday on Drawabox.
