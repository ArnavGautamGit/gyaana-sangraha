# Silken Codes of WW2
British used to have their soldiers of [[The Second World War (WW2)\|The Second World War (WW2)]] remember meanings to various poems. The messages would cme encrypted as a poem and the "meanings" were the key. For example: A soldier getting the poem "Road less travelled" in his message may mean "Clear the area for an airstrike".

I don't think we need to underline the problems here.... soldiers forgetting the cryptic meaning, soldiers forgetting poems and the poems eventually becoming too predictable.

Marks developed a coding scheme that he proposed must be written on Silk, since it was a piece of cloth that could not be discovered by patting down and searching if properly concealed...
Silk burns readily and fully. So spies could easily erase evidence and not even let the others get a small piece of the encryption key

When the higher ups questioned why should they get even a material (silk) used to make parachutes, Marks remarked "It is a choice between silk and cyanide since if the words in the poem were even remotely similar to 'our', 'gracious', 'him', 'victorious', 'send' then God save the agent".
