# Symmetric Key Encryption
> It is a type of [[Keyed Encryption\|Keyed Encryption]] which uses a singular unique key to encrypt and decrypt messages using the same unique key. The said unique key may have its copies but the same key (shared with different users) can encrypt and decrypt the data i.e., Key is Symmetric for all users.

A pertinent question that is raised due to this is how the keys are exchanged?
The Keys are distributed in many ways but one of the first algorithms used for safe exchange of Symmetric Keys in an unsafe channel was the [[Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange\|Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange]]

Popular Symmetric Key Algorithms include:
[[DES (Data Encryption Standard)\|DES (Data Encryption Standard)]]
