# Shrī Rāmānuja Sampradāya
> Began by [[Rāmānujacharya\|Rāmānujacharya]] as a subset of the [[Shrī Vaishnava\|Shrī Vaishnava]] tradition with his literary scripture [[Shrībhāshyam of Rāmānujacharya\|Shrībhāshyam of Rāmānujacharya]] which along with the [[Rāmāyaṇa\|Rāmāyaṇa]] 

In a place where he was giving [[Dīkshā\|Dīkshā]] to select few of his followers... Indresh Ji mentions in [this video](https://youtu.be/RbbgIlIvlmU?si=QkTeCPjamrF2Ox2W) that there exist 108 shrines which hold some significance or another in accordance with the Rāmānuja Sampradāya... among these one must visit the following EACH YEAR:
1. Sri Rangam at Tiruchirapalli in Tamil Nadu.
2. Sri Tirupati Balaji at Tirupati
3. Sri Vardharaja in Kanchipuram (once every 40 years)
4. Melakota

Other sites such as Sri Padhnabha Swamy Temple in Kerala are also included in the figure of 108 sites but not one in the top 4. 

### Dīkshā Procedure
Since I am not [[Dīkshā\|Dīkshita]] into the Sampradāya yet, it is important to note that I only know very basics and this is in no way the full procedure neither does it claim to be.

The First Step is Tapta (तप्त) which is a specific procedure where the heated emblems of the Sudarshana Chakra and the Panchajanya Conch Shell are placed on either shoulder (if male) or arms (if female) and then you would be provided white sandalwood (chandan) to apply to the burning hot prints. If the next day the emblems are well printed then it is considered a greatly auspicious sign and one must avoid using soap on the position or rub the region harshly for the next 3 to 4 days & only use the chandan provided.

Second Step is Pundra (पुन्ड्र) or Tilaka i.e., you would be given the Tilaka of the specific Sampradāya. It is advised not to get tilaka done from anywhere else, only do it from your own home & your own sāmagri (items) provided by the Sampradāya.

Third Step is Nāma (नाम) i.e., Name. This is common in all places that your name will be changed (not officially on govt papers) but it is a sign of being Twice-born (Dvija)

Fourth Step is Mantra (मंंत्र) i.e., you would be given a mantra by your Guru which you will have to chant everyday without fail.

Final Step is Tyāga (त्याग) i.e., Sacrifice. The idol of [[Lord Vishnu\|Lord Vishnu]] or [[Lord Krishna\|Lord Krishna]] (depending upon customs) would be placed feet-first on the head/crown of the individual & said individual must sacrifice one extremely bad behaviour once in their life.
