# Gupta Empire
> Empire in the Northern India which is referred to as the Golden Age of [[Indian History\|Indian History]].

Gupta Empire was famous for not only its efficient administration & war victories over the [[Western Kshatrapa\|Western Kshatrapa]] but also for pioneering the "Nagara" style in [[Hindu Temple Architecture\|Hindu Temple Architecture]] which is still prevalent in Northern India today.

### Formation & Major Emperors
According to certain [[Purāṇa\|Purāṇa]] texts, it is said that Gupta Empire was founded by [[Srigupta\|Srigupta]] and [[Ghatotkacha Gupta\|Ghatotkacha Gupta]] although archaeologically, we see only evidence for the oldest Gupta ruler being Ghatotkacha's first son [[Chandragupta I of Prayag\|Chandragupta I of Prayag]]. It is said that Chandragupta rose to power via matrimony i.e., marrying the princesses of other kingdoms to gain support from said kingdoms. Any future sons would rule these vassal kingdoms resulting in the vassals coming under his direct control within the next 20 years. It is also said that he started the [[Gupta Samvat Calendar\|Gupta Samvat Calendar]] with its zero year in 318-319 AD. Gupta Calendar has since died out unlike the [[Vikram Samvat Calendar\|Vikram Samvat Calendar]] which is still used in the Indian Stock Market.

[[Samudragupta\|Samudragupta]] becomes the new emperor in 335 AD and remains in power until 375 AD.
[[Hari Sena\|Hari Sena]] writes [[Prayag Prashasti Rock-Pillar Inscriptions\|Prayag Prashasti Rock-Pillar Inscriptions]] on Samudragupta's reign in [[Sanskrit\|Sanskrit]]. If these inscriptions are to be trusted then it can be deduced that Samudragupta is among the few who never faced defeat throughout his reign until his death. He took on the title of "Vikramāditya" for this military accomplishments & unification of Indian Territory. 

According to the play [[Devichandraguptam\|Devichandraguptam]] written by [[Vishakhadeva\|Vishakhadeva]] (who may or may not be [[Vishakhadatta\|Vishakhadatta]]), The play mentions that Emperor [[Samudragupta\|Samudragupta]] had two sons named [[Rāmagupta\|Rāma]] and [[Chandragupta II of Ujjain\|Chandra]] respectively. Among the two of them since Rāma was the elder son hence it was decided that he would inherit the throne in 375 AD. If the play is to be trusted, then the story goes that during the Gupta-Śaka conflict, when the [[Western Kshatrapa\|Śaka]] kings layed seige to one of their castles, the stalemate could only brokered by the ransom demanded by the Śaka King that Rāmagupta surrender his wife, [[Dhruvadevi\|Dhruvadevi]]. Chandra is angered by Rāmagupta reluctantly agreeing to this settlement & suggests he (Chandra) himself dress up as the Queen Consort [[Dhruvadevi\|Dhruvadevi]] to infiltrate the enemy camp alone. Chandra unveiled himself when the time was right and killed every single enemy soldier in the camp. After returning from a successful mission, citing that Rāma is a weak ruler he dethrones his elder brother at the end of the play & marries [[Dhruvadevi\|Dhruvadevi]] himself. It is unclear whether Chandra kills Rāma or not - although it is likely.

When Chandra ascends the throne sometime between 375-380 AD, he shifts the capital to the city of Ujjain & takes on the regnal name [[Chandragupta II of Ujjain\|Chandragupta II of Ujjain]]. He was one of the most influencial kings after his father in the entire dynasty who ruled till 414 AD.

[[Kumaragupta I\|Kumaragupta I]] ascends the throne in 414 AD after his father [[Chandragupta II of Ujjain\|Chandragupta II of Ujjain]] passed away and ruled till 455 AD. Although he ruled for a long time, he did not really do anything much significant or differentiating that we can write home about. His son [[Skandagupta\|Skandagupta]] was the last major ruler who could hold back the [[Western Kshatrapa\|Western Śaka]] and the Northern [[White Huns\|White Huns]], after him all other rulers like [[Kumaragupta II\|Kumaragupta II]], [[Kumaragupta III\|Kumaragupta III]] were weak & could not do jack shit militarily except boasting about themselves. [[Vishnugupta Chandrāditya\|Vishnugupta Chandrāditya]] was the last ruler of the Gupta Empire who ruled for 10 years from 540 AD to 550 AD.

### Cultural Contributions
Although their contributions are too many to list since this is truly considered the Golden Period of Indian History due to advancements in Science, Religion, Philosophy, Literature, Economy & ease of Social Mobility... I can try to list a few very pivotal ones.

In the Gupta Period, we began using the local resources we had to build temples. For example, in the Northern Plains, sourcing and bringing rocks from the [[Aravali Hills\|Aravali Hills]] or [[Himalayas\|Himalayas]] or [[Vindhyas\|Vindhyas]] was hard & expensive process. Guptas were one of the first to use bricks made from locally-sourced Alluvial Soil on such a large scale made with similar modern processes that we currently use to make bricks for new houses in 2026.
Apart from just temple building materials, the Guptas also pioneered the "Nagara" Style of [[Hindu Temple Architecture\|Hindu Temple Architecture]] made specifically to accomodate bricks. Due to receiving no maintainance from later kingdoms & Empires, many of the initial temples did not survive but the style of architecture is still seen in most Hindu Temples located in Northern India.

Guptas has always been appreciated for patronising the literary work of poets & authors such as [[Kālidāsa\|Kālidāsa]], [[Vishakhadeva\|Vishakhadeva]], [[Banabhatta\|Banabhatta]] etc. These poets and authors wrote about previous kings and kingdoms that existed before throughout the Indian Subcontinent.

In addition to this, Guptas invented the [[Gupta Brāhmi Script\|Gupta Brāhmi Script]] and the [[Nāgari Script\|Nāgari Script]] which were both used to write on rock & paper respectively. It is to be noted that the [[Nāgari Script\|Nāgari Script]] was used to write [[Vedic Literature\|Vedic Literature]] & other important texts of [[Hinduism\|Hinduism]] on paper & tree-bark manuscripts.
