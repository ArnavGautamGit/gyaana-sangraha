# Galapa (Daggerheart)
> A [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Ancestries/DH Species Ancestry\|DH Species Ancestry]] of anthromorphic bipedal turtles i.e., turtles that can walk on their hind limbs & use their fore limbs as hands with distinct, sharp fingers. 

Galapa's are said to decorate their shells by carving and shaping them (similar to how a soft skinned species like Humans would get tattoos) or they could reinforce their shells with Armour. Their arms tend to be very thick. Damaged shells can be repaired similar to fractured bone and repair in 2 years anyway. In roughly 10 years a heavily damaged shell regrows completely. Certain Galapa may have webbed fingers.

> [!example] Worldbuilding: Galapa-Simian War
> Galapas, [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Ancestries/Ribbet (DH)\|Ribbet]] and [[Compendiums/Gaming/TTRPG/Daggerheart Compendium/Player/Ancestries/Simiah (DH)\|Simiah]] lived together in the [[Magical Woods\|Magical Woods]]. The Simians felt the Ribbets and Galapa are coming together to form an alliance and left the Council - leading to the breakdown of order, Ribbetts retreated to [[Ribbetton\|Ribbetton]] and the Galapa-Simian tensions got bad enough that it got to War. At the start of [[Storms of Eslance\|Storms of Eslance]], the Forest is divided into North and South zones where the South one bordering the Orcs is ruled by Simiah. It is rumoured that the Simiah were an Orc proxy due to using Orc weapons. Dragonpeaks covertly armed Galapas too - but the weapons were not as distinctive to be identified as such. Some Galapas are also living as tribes constituting a minority around [[Aurelia\|Aurelia]] and the [[Scar Lake Forest\|Scar Lake Forest]].

On taking Galapa, you get the following Ancestry Features:

Lifespan of an Average Galapa: 150 years on Average
