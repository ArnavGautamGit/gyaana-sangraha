# FRH Nagthat
It is a [[Forest Rest House\|Forest Rest House]] in [[Nāgthāt (नागथात)\|Nāgthāt (नागथात)]] built at the best possible location on the ridge.

It is managed by Mr. Suresh Rathi & his family who live close-by. It is built on a strategic location where 270 degree views are visible from the rest house garden and the other side of the ridge can be reached by a simple [[Trek to the top of the ridge\|Trek to the top of the ridge]]

It is a great place to stay however washrooms have a flush problem, there is only 1 english style washroom. Not to mention its closeness to the wilderness means that it will have a problem of bugs and insects if you visit in or near the monsoon (offseason)

It is a great place to stay in-season like in May or October. Although the surroundings look better in October.

### Living-Dining Area
Inside the door opens into the living-dining area and a satellite TataSky TV right next to the door on the left. The left side right in front of the TV are 4 sofas and a fireplace on the opposite wall to the TV. The right half is a dining table that can seat 6 people easily and the sink & Water Purifier connected to the same divide the two.

### The Bedrooms
As you enter through the main door, on your left (beyond the TV) are two doors leading to 2 massive Master Bedrooms. The rooms are massive and spacious. I and mom slept in the room closer to the door whereas Papa slept in the other room. Both rooms had ample space to keep your luggage and Papa's room had a metal trunk which God knows can ope or not.

The FRH is right next to 3 mobile towers with 4G (not 4G+) connection speeds so connection is no problem at all.
