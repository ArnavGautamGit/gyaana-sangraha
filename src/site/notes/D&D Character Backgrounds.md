# D&D Character Backgrounds
> Note containing the list of all Backgrounds available for any D&D character according to the 2024 edition of the [[Compendiums/D&D Compendium/Corebooks/D&D Player's Handbook\|D&D Player's Handbook]]

Most of the information here is taken from Chapter 4 of the Player's Handbook - if otherwise, source will be mentioned in the text.

### Parts of a Background
According to the Player's Handbook, Chapter 4 (Page 177) all the Backgrounds mentioned in the PHB contain the following things: 
1. ***Ability Score Increase*** - Either two ability scores increased (one by +2 and one +1) or three ability scores increased (each by +1).
2. ***Feat*** - Also called a "Background Feature", it is a special ability that can be activated when requirements are met to aid the character or their allies.
3. ***Skill Proficiency*** - Skills that are related to the character's background we can get backgrounds.
4. ***Tool Proficiency*** - Tools that a character would know how to use dependent upon the background. Either a specific tool or any tool of choice from the list in Chapter 6 of the [[Compendiums/D&D Compendium/Corebooks/D&D Player's Handbook\|PHB]].
5. ***Equipment*** - Choice to get a pack of equipment vs the choice of getting 50 GP instead.
