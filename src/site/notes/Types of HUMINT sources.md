# Different types of HUMINT sources & how to handle them
There are multiple types of [[HUMINT\|HUMINT]] sources that can be present for an Intelligence Officer to encounter problems with:
1. Ideology-driven Source
2. Money-minded Source
3. Source Vulnerable to Honey-trapping

The Ideology driven source is often made to believe that he is serving a higher ideological cause for his ideology by providing information. Although the officer must be weary to remove the extra layer of "Ideological [[Story Bias\|Story Bias]]" by asking the following questions:
- Who is the sender?
- What is their intentions?
- What are they trying to hide?

Money-minded Sources are ready to exchange any information you want if you have pockets that are deep enough. They are considered more accurate but the handler may actually make a few mistakes in handling such sources by rewarding wrong reports which may make the sources split reports for more money - basic [[Incentive Super-Response Theory\|Incentive Super-Response Theory]].

Sources Vulnerable to [[Honey-Trapping\|Honey-Trapping]] are honey trapped to reveal information. [[MOSSAD\|MOSSAD]] deals in this a lot more than any other Intelligence Agency. Pakistan has also started using this honeytrapping technique to get crucial information about Indian Defences especially the [[BrahMos\|BrahMos]].

While dealing with a source, it is important to:
- Not hold grudges against them
- if needed, make them believe that you are working for some other country or some other private company.
- if needed use any and all [[Deception Techniques\|Deception Techniques]]
