# Standard Deviation & Variance
> Standard Deviation is mathematical and numerical measure in a set of data that aims to find the level of deviation (from the [[Mathematical Mean\|Mean]]) that is present in said set of data.

Standard Deviation is used a lot in plotting [[Bell Curves\|Bell Curves]] potraying an image of the statistical average in a dataset. Heavily used in calculations that formed the basis of the study surrounding the [[Intelligence Quotient (IQ)\|Intelligence Quotient (IQ)]].
Learning example is given in the subheading for the [[Standard Deviation & Variance#Example\|Example]].

When mathematically represented, the formula for Standard Deviation is:
$$\Large \sigma = \sqrt{\dfrac{\sum(v - \mu)^2}{n}}$$
Here, $\large\mu =$ the [[Mathematical Mean\|Mean]], 
$\large v=$ individual values in the dataset
$\large n$ refers to the number of values in the dataset

The value of $\large (v - \mu)^2$ is found for each value of $\large v$ that is given to us. then it is averaged by dividing the sum of all the values by the number of total values represented by $\large n$.

Similarly, the formula for Variance is:
$$\Large (\sigma)^2 = \dfrac{\sum(v - \mu)^2}{n}$$
here, $\large \mu =$ [[Mathematical Mean\|Mathematical Mean]] of the dataset and $\large v$ stands for individual values.

### Example
If the standard height of men in India is (for example) 170 centrimetres with a standard deviation of 5 centrimetres then that means:
1. 68% of men in India have a height of approximately 170 $\pm$ 5 centrimetres i.e., within first standard deviation. 
2. 95% of men would have a height of 170 $\pm$ 10 centimetres i.e, within second standard deviation.
3. 2% of men would have height of 170 + 20 centimetres or more (probability progressively reducing as we move away from the [[Mathematical Mean\|Mathematical Mean]]).
4. 2% of men would have height of 170 - 20 centimetres or less (probability progressively decreases as we go away from the [[Mathematical Mean\|Mathematical Mean]]).
