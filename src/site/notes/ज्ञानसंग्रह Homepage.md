# Welcome to ज्ञानसंग्रह !!

ज्ञानसंग्रह is a Sanskrit name formed by the concatenation of two Sanskrit Words: 
1. ज्ञान (Knowledge or Wisdom) 
2. संग्रह (Repository)

Putting them together you can easily understand that this is a Knowledge Repository which I use for learning in public and simultaneously backing up my notes via GitHub.

You are free to press Ctrl+K (or Cmd+K for Mac Users) to open the Search bar & search for a specific item or note if you want to look for something specific or click on the Menu icon on the top left to open the list of notes to check them out! 

Please ignore the chaos in the sidebar menu since organising this now will require me to manually move 1000+ notes into respective folders, not to mention first creating and sorting said folders. I am trying to move towards a menu-less Repository - of how you do not need to scroll through a list of pages when browsing wikipedia, you just search for stuff.

If you are here to hire me? Please look at [[My Résumé\|My Résumé]].
Else, please keep reading.

# Intro to the संग्रह (Repository)
I would not call myself a polymath, but I will say that I am trying my best to become one.
For Academic Notes in Computer Science or Social Sciences, please look at: [[Academics\|Academics]].

Each of the newer note is made without a creation & updation date on it - so they are timeless. Each note starts with a quotebox which explains either what the note is about or defines the topic of the note.
