# Data Privacy
> The Ability or (in some countries) the Constitutional Right to seclude or hide information about themselves regardless of how sensitive or mundane it would be.

We know how many companies around the world participate in [[Data Mining\|Data Mining]] via the Internet in the name of "personalising" the experience. [[Vikram Sood\|Vikram Sood]] - former chief of India's [[R&AW\|R&AW]] (via in his book, [[The Unending Game\|The Unending Game]]) even called this act of data mining not being punished as a part of Espionage since it is used extensively for [[Mass-Surveillance\|Mass-Surveillance]] of Netizens and [[National Security\|National Security]] by [[The Five Eyes\|The Five Eyes]] Nations.

Data Privacy during Data Mining is maintained by the data being [[Data Anonymisation\|Anonymised]] i.e, all Identifiers that can be used to directly identify a person like name, exact address are removed. While all of the Quasi-Identifiers are either masked or they are modified to be indirect.

Generally in cases of [[Data Mining\|Data Mining]], the data has all the identifiers removed but why do companies not want to do that? Because it hurts Transparency in their data. The results obtained from [[Data Anonymisation\|anonymised data]] are neither as high quality nor as accurate (due to missing information) and this is why a leaked dataset sells for such a good price on the [[Dark Web\|Dark Web]].
