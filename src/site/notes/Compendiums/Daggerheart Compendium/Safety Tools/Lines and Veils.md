# Lines and Veils
> Safety Tool used in any [[Table-Top Role-Playing Game\|Table-Top Role-Playing Game]] as a living document of things people do not want to see in the game.

- *line* is something that cannot occur at all or even be mentioned.
- *veil* is something that can be mentioned but not lingered upon or a "fade-to-black" sort of scenario.

It is a living document made public to the players with its first iteration formed by discussion with the players in the [[Compendiums/Daggerheart Compendium/Safety Tools/Session Zero\|Session Zero]]. It is then revisted and edited periodically in the campaign.
