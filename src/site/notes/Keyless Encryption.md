# Keyless Encryption
> Special Mathematical [[Cryptographic Encryption Algorithms\|Cryptographic Encryption Algorithms]] which do not require a Key. They were primarily developed in the ancient times to be used on the field by spies posted in other countries or hostile areas. 

Not many are known or in syllabus. Although an example for keyless encryption is found in Simon Singh's The Code Book where he mentions:
Certain messengers in the ancient time had to get their heads shaven and wait in the castle for many months until the hair regrew to conceal the message and then their heads were shaven again to see the message on the receiver end. They would travel posing as traders or wayfarers. Other cases where messages were concealed on other body parts are also found.
