# What is meant by "Salient Features"?
>*Salient features are such characteristics which distinguishes the Indian Constitution from other Constitutions of the world*

Reading the Previous chapter (i.e.,[[Definitions and Terms\|Definitions and Terms]]), you may have thought that most of our constitution is copied from other countries, while thatmay be true to some extent but we'l see that in next class.
Basic Features discussed in those chapters ***CANNOT*** be ammended.

# What are the Salient Features?
1. ==India has the World's Lengthiest Constitutions==: 
   It is the longest written constitution of any sovereign state in the world, at **145,000 words**. By comparison, the US constitution has just 4,400 words. The original constitution had 8 schedules and 395 articles in 22 parts. The Current version has 448 Articles in 24 Parts along with 12 Schedules
2. ==Mix of Unitarianism and Federalism==:
   India is a Union of states - it is similar to a federal system but unlike the federal system - the Central Government is more powerful than the states. Also, it is impossible for a state to leave the Union, but it is not impossible (although still very hard) for a state to leave the Federal System.
3. ==Preamble to Constitution==:
   The term ‘Preamble’ which is described as the introduction or preface to the Constitution is nothing but the summary of the constitutional goals. [Preamble(Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preamble_to_the_Constitution_of_India)
4. ==Singular Citizenship==:
   No Citizenship of any other country or state allowed (Examples: A person cannot hold a Tamil citizenship with Indian Citizenship neither a British AND Indian Citizenship ***at the same time***)
5. ==Adult Suffrage==:
   Article 326 of the constitution provides for the ‘right to vote’ to all citizens who have completed 18 years of age. (earlier used to be 25, then reduced to 21)
6. ==Recast by Amendments==:
   - Our Constitution has been recast by amendments like 7th, 42nd, 44th , 73rd, 74th , 104th
   - There are 104 amendments that have been made in the Indian constitution up to January 25, 2020.
   - The very first amendment in the Indian Constitution was made in 1950.

7. [[Fundamental Rights\|Fundamental Rights]]  (also called FRs)
8. [[Fundamental Duties\|Fundamental Duties]] 
9. [[Directive Principles of State Policy\|Directive Principles of State Policy]] (also called DPSPs)
10. [[Bi-Cameral Legislature.canvas]]
11. ==Parliamentary Form of Government==: We took this feature from the UK. It is stated to be roughly the same as the UK except the UK has a Monarchy (which we have replaced with a President) and India allows Judicial Review (unlike the UK)
12. ==Judicial Review==: Any Law can be reviewed by the Judiciary via Article 13 (we took this from the USA). The Supreme Court (via Article 32) and The High Court (via Article 226) are considered the Sentinels of Society. The UK considers the Parliament to be Supreme but India makes sure that no one has infinite power, especially Politicans do not.
13. ==Judicial Activism==: Judges of the hon'ble Supreme Court are entitled enough to not need a case to be filed under Article 32 (or any other article) to need to take action. They can Suo Motto any issue and fight it themselves. Although PILs (Public Interest Litigations) which are a by-product of this are a great initiative (up there with RTI Act)
14. ==Emergencies==: The President (under advise from the Cabinet and the National Government) is authorised to declare National and Financial Emergencies (under Articles 352 and 360 respectively) to have the Prime Minister have all the powers of Legislative and Executive while being immune to Judicial effects. All Fundamental Rights except Article 20 and Article 21 are suspended. State Emergencies are invoked by the State Governor in cases of complete breakdown of law and order in a state (according to Article 356). State Emergencies can also be applied by the President if they feel that the State's Governor is not doing a good job upholding Constitutional values. Article 356 is also called "President's Rule" and the CM and CM's State Cabinet is dissolved.
