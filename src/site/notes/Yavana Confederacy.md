# Yavana Confederacy
> Confederacy of many city-states with rulers of [[Indo-Greeks\|Indo-Greek]] ethnicity in the North-western part of India (modern-day Pakistan and eastern Afghanistan) which broke away from the [[Mauryan Empire\|Mauryan Empire]] at the time of its collapse. Some may have invaded as broke-away factions of the [[Selucid Empire\|Selucid Empire]].

[[Menander I Soter\|Menander I Soter]] is the most famous ruler from this confederacy who later converted to [[Bauddha (Buddhism)\|Buddhism]] under the influence of Buddhist Monk named Nagarjuna (sometimes called Nagasena). Menander is his Greek name while Indians call him as Milind.

### Formation
The kingdom broke free from the [[Mauryan Empire\|Mauryan Empire]] & declared independence when it collapsed after [[Pushyamitra Shunga\|Pushyamitra Shunga]] assassinated Brihadratha Maurya, the 9th Emperor of the Mauryan Empire. Following is the exerpt from the note on Mauryans:

[[Later Mauryan Emperors\|Later Mauryan Emperors]] after the death of [[Ashoka\|Ashoka]] were too weak & soft, they could not lead as well. Due to none of the Mauryan Emperors being followers of [[Hinduism\|Hinduism]], it weakened their connect with the people - particularly the Brahmins. Eventually [[Pushyamitra Shunga\|Pushyamitra Shunga]] who was a Brahmin by caste decided to publically assassinate the last Mauryan Emperor named "Brihadratha" in 185 BC and takes the throne for himself to find the [[Shunga Dynasty\|Shunga Dynasty]] controlling the Northern Gangetic Plains and the Central Indian regions upto the shores of river Narmada to the south of which (including regions like the Andhras and Karnataka) were controlled by local fragmented tribal rulers which we don't know much about due to no [[Archaeological Evidence\|Archaeological]] or [[Literary Records\|Literary Records]] of the time known as the "Dark Age of Central India" until the [[Sātavāhana Empire\|Sātavāhana Empire]] rose a century later.

### Major Rulers
There were only a few in the confederacy that were able to rule all of the city states at once & the conflict of multiple rulers ruling parts of the kingdom/confederacy created a lot of fracturing past the 130 BC mark & there have been few instances before then that there have been 2 simultaneous kings.

[[Demetrius I Anicetus\|Demetrius I Anicetus]] (200 BC to 190 BC) ---> founder, ruled over all city states at once, called Dimetriya in India
[[Menander I Soter\|Menander I Soter]] (155 BC to 130 BC) ---> called Milind by Indians
[[Antialcidas Nikephoros\|Antialcidas Nikephoros]] (115 BC to 95 BC) ---> sent [[Heliodorus\|Heliodorus]] to India.
